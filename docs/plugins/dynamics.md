## Attack Tonal Balance

Balances short, broadband attacks against sustained tonal structure in the same frequency range. Use it when you want percussion and note onsets to stand out more or less without applying the same change to sustained notes. Unlike Transient Shaper, it separates the two parts from their time-frequency patterns rather than fast and slow level envelopes; unlike Multiband Transient, it is not divided into fixed bass, midrange, and treble bands.

### Listening Enhancement Guide

- Leave Attack Enabled and Tonal Enabled checked, start with both gain controls at 0 dB, then adjust one at a time in 1 to 3 dB steps.
- Raise Attack for clearer drum hits, plucked strings, and note onsets. Lower it to soften sharp or tiring attacks.
- Raise Tonal to bring sustained notes, chords, and vocal tones forward. Lower it when sustained pitched content dominates the mix.
- Clear either Enabled checkbox to cut that separated component while you compare or shape the other one. Its gain setting is retained, but the corresponding slider and number field are unavailable until you enable it again.
- Positive settings can raise peaks or perceived loudness. Compare at a similar listening level and reduce the output level if necessary.

### Parameters

- **Attack Enabled** (default: on)
  - Includes the separated Attack component in the output. Clear it to cut that component.

- **Attack** (-12 dB to +12 dB, default: 0 dB, 0.5 dB steps)
  - Adjusts short structures that spread across nearby frequencies.
  - Positive values emphasize attacks; negative values soften them.

- **Tonal Enabled** (default: on)
  - Includes the separated Tonal component in the output. Clear it to cut that component.

- **Tonal** (-12 dB to +12 dB, default: 0 dB, 0.5 dB steps)
  - Adjusts structures that remain stable over time.
  - Positive values emphasize sustained tonal content; negative values reduce it.

### Delay and Separation Limits

The effect adds a fixed processing delay of 5,120 samples at 48 kHz (about 107 ms). It identifies spectral patterns, not instruments or sources, and it does not decide whether a sound has a musically correct pitch. Rapid pitch changes, sustained noise, dense percussion, and strongly modulated sounds may be divided less clearly. Content that is not clearly Attack or Tonal remains at its original level, so clearing both Enabled checkboxes does not make the output silent.

## Auto Leveler

A smart volume control that automatically adjusts your music to maintain a consistent listening level. It uses a LUFS-style level estimate to keep playback closer to your chosen target, whether you're listening to quiet classical pieces or dynamic pop songs.

## Brickwall Limiter

A peak limiter that keeps the chain's digital signal below a specified ceiling while preserving as much of the music's dynamics as possible. Place it near the end of the effect chain when earlier effects create high peaks. It limits signal peaks, but does not guarantee safe listening levels or protect playback equipment; set the listening volume on your playback device.

### Listening Enhancement Guide

- Put the limiter near the end of the chain, before **Level Meter**, to catch peaks created by EQ, saturation, or other effects.
- Start with Input Gain at 0 dB, Threshold at -3 dB, Margin at -1 dB, and Release at 100 ms.
- If limiting is frequent or the music loses impact, lower Input Gain or raise Threshold toward 0 dB.
- If you hear pumping, lengthen Release. If transients sound smeared or distorted, try a shorter Release or reduce the amount of limiting.
- Use **Level Meter** after the limiter to confirm the resulting digital peak level. Adjust your amplifier or playback device separately for listening volume.

### Parameters

- **Input Gain** (-18dB to +18dB)
  - Adjusts the level going into the limiter
  - Increase to make peaks hit the limiter more often
  - Decrease if you hear too much limiting
  - Default is 0dB

- **Threshold** (-24dB to 0dB)
  - Sets the peak level where limiting begins before Margin is applied
  - The effective ceiling is Threshold + Margin
  - Lower values leave more peak headroom
  - Higher values preserve more dynamics
  - Start at -3dB for light peak limiting

- **Release Time** (10ms to 500ms)
  - How quickly limiting is released
  - Faster times maintain more dynamics
  - Slower times for smoother sound
  - Try 100ms as a starting point

- **Lookahead** (0ms to 10ms)
  - Allows the limiter to anticipate peaks
  - Higher values for more transparent limiting
  - Lower values for less latency
  - 3ms is a good balance

- **Margin** (-1.000dB to 0.000dB)
  - Adds a fine downward offset to the Threshold
  - The actual ceiling is Threshold + Margin
  - For example, Threshold -3dB with Margin -1.000dB limits around -4dB
  - Default -1.000dB works well for most material
  - Adjust for precise peak control

- **Oversampling** (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x)
  - 1x (default) preserves the original processing. Above 1x, filtering adds 64 samples of delay in addition to Lookahead (about 1.33 ms at 48 kHz).
  - Higher values for cleaner limiting
  - Lower values for less CPU usage
  - 4x is a good balance of quality and performance

## Multiband Transient

A three-band transient shaper for finished music. It divides the sound into Low, Mid, and High ranges, then lets you adjust attack and sustain in each range so the music can feel punchier, tighter, softer, or more relaxed without changing every frequency the same way.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Classical Music:
  - Make string attacks a little clearer while controlling low-frequency hall resonance
  - Shape piano transients differently across the frequency spectrum for more balanced sound
  - Soften sharp treble attacks while keeping orchestral weight intact
- Rock/Pop Music:
  - Make drum hits in finished tracks feel more immediate without raising the whole track
  - Tighten boomy low-frequency sustain while keeping midrange presence clear
  - Soften sharp attacks in the treble range when a recording sounds edgy
- Electronic Music:
  - Make bass hits feel firmer while keeping the rest of the track controlled
  - Reduce long low-frequency sustain when bass feels smeared
  - Add or reduce bite in bright synth and percussion ranges

### Frequency Bands

The Multiband Transient processor splits your audio into three carefully designed frequency bands. Because this works by frequency band, not source separation, each adjustment affects all sounds in that band.

- **Low Band** (Below Freq 1)
  - Controls bass and sub-bass frequencies
  - Useful for shaping bass impact, low-frequency thumps, and resonance
  - Default crossover: 200 Hz

- **Mid Band** (Between Freq 1 and Freq 2)  
  - Handles the critical midrange frequencies
  - Contains most vocal and instrumental presence
  - Default crossover: 200 Hz to 4000 Hz

- **High Band** (Above Freq 2)
  - Manages treble and air frequencies
  - Controls cymbals, guitar picks, and brightness
  - Default crossover: Above 4000 Hz

### Parameters

#### Crossover Frequencies
- **Freq 1** (20Hz to 2000Hz)
  - Sets the Low/Mid crossover point
  - Lower values: More content in mid and high bands
  - Higher values: More content in low band
  - Default: 200Hz

- **Freq 2** (max(Freq 1, 200Hz) to 20000Hz)
  - Sets the Mid/High crossover point
  - Lower values: More content in high band
  - Higher values: More content in mid band
  - If set below Freq 1, it is automatically raised to Freq 1
  - Default: 4000Hz

#### Per-Band Controls (Low, Mid, High)
Each frequency band has independent transient shaping controls:

  - How long the sustain portion is tracked
  - Lower values: Shorter sustain detection
  - Higher values: Longer sustain tail tracking
  - Typical range: 150ms to 500ms

- **Transient Gain** (-24dB to +24dB)
  - Enhances or reduces the attack portion
  - Positive values: More punch and definition
  - Negative values: Softer, less aggressive attacks
  - Typical range: 0dB to +12dB
