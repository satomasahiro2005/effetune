# Verification

The frozen wrapper reference origin is 82 JavaScript-derived effect suites,
6 native direct-double suites, 1 independent native-reference suites, and 21 production-native-promoted suites. The independent native reference validates IIR filtering with RBJ biquads in direct form I and linear-phase filtering with direct FIR convolution. Maintainers run:

```console
node tools/verify-dsp-library-goldens.mjs
```

See the stable [DSP Library workflow and runs](https://github.com/Frieve-A/effetune/actions/workflows/dsp-library-ci.yml).
CI acceptance summaries are temporary workflow artifacts, not public Release assets.
The repository Chromium harness uses a special `file:` flag; that exception is not a
public browser-support claim.
