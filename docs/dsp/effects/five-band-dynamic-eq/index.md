# 5Band Dynamic EQ

Semantic type: `FiveBandDynamicEQ` · Category: eq

Applies level-dependent equalization in five configurable bands.

This type has catalog telemetry metadata but no public observation API. See [Compatibility](/dsp/reference/compatibility/#analyzers-and-telemetry).

## Contract

- Seeded: **no**
- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**
- Assets: **none**
- Catalog-declared latency: **zero**
- Telemetry: **catalog metadata only; no public observation API**

## 5Band Dynamic EQ

A smart equalizer that automatically adjusts frequency bands based on the content of your music. It combines precise equalization with dynamic processing that responds to changes in your music in real-time, creating an enhanced listening experience without constant manual adjustments.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Tame Harsh Vocals:
  - Use peak filter at 3000Hz with higher ratio (4.0-10.0)
  - Set moderate threshold (-24dB) and fast attack (10ms)
  - Automatically reduces harshness only when vocals get too aggressive
- Enhance Clarity and Brilliance:
  - Use Band 5 with Filter Type: Highshelf, Frequency: around 10000Hz, SC Freq: around 1200Hz, Ratio: 0.5, Attack: 1ms
  - Mids trigger high frequencies for natural-sounding clarity
  - Adds sparkle to music without permanent brightness
- Control Excessive Bass:
  - Use lowshelf filter at 100Hz with moderate ratio (2.0-4.0)
  - Keep bass impact while preventing speaker distortion
  - Perfect for bass-heavy music on smaller speakers
- Adaptive Sound Tailoring:
  - Lets music dynamics control the sound balance
  - Automatically adjusts to different songs and recordings
  - Maintains consistent sound quality across your playlist

### Parameters
- **Five Band Controls** - Each with independent settings
  - Band 1: 100Hz (Bass Region)
  - Band 2: 300Hz (Lower Midrange)
  - Band 3: 1000Hz (Midrange)
  - Band 4: 3000Hz (Upper Midrange)
  - Band 5: 10000Hz (High Frequencies)
- **Band Settings**
  - Filter Type: Choose between Peak, Lowshelf, or Highshelf
  - Frequency: Fine-tune center/corner frequency (20Hz-20kHz)
  - Q: Control bandwidth/sharpness (0.1-10.0)
  - Max Gain: Set maximum gain adjustment (0-24dB)
  - Threshold: Set level when processing begins (-60dB to 0dB)
  - Ratio: Control processing intensity (0.1-100.0)
    - Below 1.0: Expander (enhances when signal exceeds threshold)
    - Above 1.0: Compressor (reduces when signal exceeds threshold)
  - Knee Width: Smooth transition around threshold (0-10dB)
  - Attack: How quickly processing begins (0.1-100ms)
  - Release: How quickly processing ends (1-1000ms)
  - Sidechain Frequency: Detection frequency (20Hz-20kHz)
  - Sidechain Q: Detection bandwidth (0.1-10.0)
