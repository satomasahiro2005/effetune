Semantic type: `HarmonicDistortion` · Category: saturation

Adds configurable harmonic components derived from the input.

## Contract

- Seeded: **no**
- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**

## Harmonic Distortion

The Harmonic Distortion plugin shapes the waveform with adjustable 2nd- to 5th-order nonlinear terms. It lets you tune even- and odd-order distortion character from subtle warmth to stronger coloration, which can help music that sounds too clean, thin, or flat feel more vivid.

**Oversampling**: Choose 1x (default), 2x, 4x, 8x. Higher settings reduce unwanted tones caused by high-frequency harmonics folding back into the audible range, but use more CPU. Start with 2x or 4x; use 8x for stronger suppression at 48 kHz. 1x preserves the original processing. Settings above 1x add 64 samples of delay (about 1.33 ms at 48 kHz).

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- **Subtle Effect:**
  - Adds a gentle layer of harmonic warmth
  - Enhances the natural tone without overwhelming the original signal
  - Ideal for adding analog-like subtle depth
- **Moderate Effect:**
  - Adds a more pronounced harmonic character
  - Can add body, brightness, or edge to the whole recording
  - Useful when the sound feels too flat or restrained
- **Aggressive Effect:**
  - Intensifies several nonlinear terms for a rich, complex distortion
  - Creates bold textures for experimental listening
  - Can sound edgy or unconventional when pushed hard
- **Positive vs. Negative Values:**
  - Positive and negative values flip the direction of each nonlinear term
  - Even-order terms mainly change asymmetry and tonal color
  - Odd-order terms mainly change the symmetric distortion character

### Parameters
- **2nd Harm (%):** Sets the second-order distortion term (-30 to 30%, default: 2%)
- **3rd Harm (%):** Sets the third-order distortion term (-30 to 30%, default: 3%)
- **4th Harm (%):** Sets the fourth-order distortion term (-30 to 30%, default: 0.5%)
- **5th Harm (%):** Sets the fifth-order distortion term (-30 to 30%, default: 0.3%)
- **Sensitivity (x):** Adjusts the overall input sensitivity (0.1-2.0, default: 0.5)
  - Lower sensitivity provides a more understated effect
  - Higher sensitivity increases the distortion intensity
  - Works as a global control affecting the intensity of the nonlinear shaping

### Quick Start Guide
1. **Initialization:** Start with default settings (2nd: 2%, 3rd: 3%, 4th: 0.5%, 5th: 0.3%, Sensitivity: 0.5)
2. **Adjust Parameters:** Change one or two harmonic controls at a time while listening for harshness or loss of clarity
3. **Blend Your Sound:** Balance the effect using Sensitivity to achieve either a subtle warmth or a pronounced distortion
