## Comb Filter

A comb filter that adds a phasey, hollow, metallic, or resonant character by mixing the sound with a very short delayed copy. Use it when you want a track to feel more colored, spacious, or experimental.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Add Subtle Coloration:
  - Start with Feedforward mode, Feedback Gain around 0.2-0.4, and Dry-Wet Mix around 20-40%
  - Adjust the Fundamental Frequency until the hollow or phasey tone fits the music
  - Keep feedback low for a gentler effect that blends with the original sound
- Create Resonance and Echo Effects:
  - Use Feedback mode or higher Feedback Gain for stronger ringing or echo-like effects
  - Experiment with different fundamental frequencies for unique tonal character
  - Use lower Dry-Wet Mix values if the effect becomes too obvious
- Bright Metallic Color:
  - Try higher Fundamental Frequency values for brighter, wider-spaced comb peaks and dips
  - Use positive or negative Feedback Gain to change the pattern of peaks and dips
  - Combine with other effects for more experimental listening effects

### Parameters
- **Fundamental Frequency (Hz)** - Controls the delay time and harmonic spacing (20Hz to 20000Hz)
  - Lower values: Longer delays, closer-spaced comb peaks and dips
  - Higher values: Shorter delays, wider-spaced comb peaks and dips
- **Feedback Gain** - Controls the intensity of the comb filter effect (-1.0 to 1.0)
  - Negative values: Creates inverse harmonic patterns
  - Positive values: Creates reinforcing harmonic patterns
  - Zero: No effect (dry signal only)
  - Higher absolute values: More pronounced effect
- **Comb Type** - Controls the filter structure
  - Feedforward: Creates harmonic enhancement without feedback
  - Feedback: Creates resonance and echo-like effects
- **Dry-Wet Mix** - Controls the balance between processed and original signal (0% to 100%)
  - 0%: Original signal only
  - 50%: Equal mix of original and processed
  - 100%: Processed signal only

### Technical Details
- **Delay Calculation**: Delay time = 1 / Fundamental Frequency
- **Harmonic Response**: Creates regularly spaced peaks and dips based on the fundamental frequency
- **Spatial Coloration**: Can resemble short reflections, hollow coloration, or metallic resonance
- **Real-time Visualization**: Shows frequency response with fundamental frequency marker
