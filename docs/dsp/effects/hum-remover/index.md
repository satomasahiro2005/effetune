## Hum Remover

Hum Remover reduces a steady electrical mains hum and its harmonics, such as a 50 Hz or 60 Hz buzz from a turntable, cable, or power-related fault. It is for a constant tone, not general background noise.

### Listening Guide

1. Start with **Frequency** set to **Auto**, **Harmonics** at 8, and **Tracking Speed** at 50%.
2. If you know the mains frequency in the recording, choose **50 Hz** or **60 Hz**. Otherwise, leave **Auto** selected and check the displayed **FUNDAMENTAL**.
3. Raise **Harmonics** when audible buzz remains above the fundamental; lower it if the music loses too much body or detail.
4. Raise **Tracking Speed** when a hum slowly drifts in pitch; lower it for a stable hum if you want gentler tracking.
5. If sustained bass or another musical tone exactly matches a hum harmonic, lower **Harmonics** to leave that frequency less affected.

### Parameters

- **Frequency** (**Auto**, **50 Hz**, or **60 Hz**; default **Auto**) selects the hum fundamental. **Auto** follows a detected mains-like hum; choose a fixed value when the hum is known to be 50 Hz or 60 Hz.
- **Harmonics** (1–64, default 8) chooses how many multiples of the fundamental are removed. Higher values can clear more buzz, while lower values preserve more musical content near higher harmonics. The slider uses a logarithmic scale to give lower settings more adjustment space.
- **Tracking Speed** (0–100%, default 50%) controls how quickly automatic tracking follows a changing hum. Higher values follow drift more quickly; lower values change more slowly and suit a stable hum.
