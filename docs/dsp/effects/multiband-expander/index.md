## Multiband Expander

A five-band listening processor that can restore some natural contrast to overly flat or heavily compressed recordings. It works separately in each frequency range, usually making below-threshold sounds quieter, while ratio settings below 1:1 can lift quieter sounds instead.

### Key Features
- 5-band processing with adjustable crossover frequencies
- Independent expansion controls for each band
- Optimized default settings for gentle dynamic contrast restoration
- Real-time visualization of expansion activity per band
- High-quality Linkwitz-Riley crossover filters

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Pop/Rock Music:
  - Reduce the "wall of sound" effect from over-compressed recordings
  - Restore dynamic contrast between verses and choruses
  - Improve the flat impression of streaming audio sources
- Classical Music:
  - Restore the natural dynamic ebb and flow of recordings
  - Enhance contrast between quiet passages and loud crescendos
  - Bring back the vivid expression of orchestral performances
- Jazz Music:
  - Enhance the natural dynamics between instruments
  - Make quiet solos more intimate and loud sections more powerful
  - Restore the natural breathing of jazz performances

### Default Frequency Bands
The crossover frequencies are adjustable; these are the default band ranges.

- Band 1 (Low): Below 100 Hz
  - Controls the deep bass and sub frequencies
  - Gentle expansion with longer attack/release for natural bass dynamics
- Band 2 (Low-Mid): 100-500 Hz
  - Handles the upper bass and lower midrange
  - Moderate expansion to restore warmth and body
- Band 3 (Mid): 500-2000 Hz
  - Critical vocal and instrument presence range
  - Balanced expansion to preserve naturalness
- Band 4 (High-Mid): 2000-8000 Hz
  - Controls presence and air
  - Light expansion with faster response
- Band 5 (High): Above 8000 Hz
  - Manages brightness and sparkle
  - Quick response times with gentler expansion

### Parameters

#### Crossover Frequencies
- **Freq 1** (20Hz to 500Hz, default 100Hz)
  - Sets the Low/Low-Mid crossover point
- **Freq 2** (100Hz to 2000Hz, default 500Hz)
  - Sets the Low-Mid/Mid crossover point
- **Freq 3** (500Hz to 8000Hz, default 2000Hz)
  - Sets the Mid/High-Mid crossover point
- **Freq 4** (1000Hz to 20000Hz, default 8000Hz)
  - Sets the High-Mid/High crossover point
- Frequencies are kept in ascending order automatically, so moving one control can raise the next crossover if needed

#### Per-Band Controls
- **Threshold** (-60dB to 0dB)
  - Sets the level where expansion begins
  - Signals below this level are processed by the Ratio setting
- **Ratio** (1:0.05 to 1:20)
  - 1:1: No change
  - Above 1:1: Makes sounds below the threshold quieter
  - Below 1:1: Raises quieter sounds instead of reducing them
  - For natural dynamic restoration, start around 1.1:1 to 1.2:1
- **Attack** (0.1ms to 100ms)
  - How quickly expansion responds
  - Faster times for precise transient control
- **Release** (10ms to 1000ms)
  - How quickly gain returns to normal
  - Longer times for smoother, more natural sound
- **Knee** (0dB to 12dB)
  - Smoothness of expansion onset
  - Higher values for more natural transition
- **Gain** (-12dB to +12dB)
  - Output level adjustment per band
  - Fine-tune the frequency balance

### Dynamic Range Restoration
The Multiband Expander comes with optimized default settings for gently restoring contrast in over-compressed material:

- Low Band (< 100 Hz)
  - Gentle expansion (1.2:1) for controlled bass dynamics
  - Longer attack/release to maintain punch
  - Threshold set to accommodate typical bass energy

- Low-Mid Band (100-500 Hz)
  - Moderate expansion (1.2:1)
  - Balanced timing for natural response
  - Threshold is tuned for typical low-mid energy

- Mid Band (500-2000 Hz)
  - Balanced expansion (1.2:1)
  - Medium response times
  - Optimized for vocal and instrument dynamics

- High-Mid Band (2000-8000 Hz)
  - Light expansion (1.1:1)
  - Faster attack/release
  - Natural presence restoration

- High Band (> 8000 Hz)
  - Gentlest expansion (1.1:1)
  - Very quick response times
  - Subtle air and sparkle enhancement

This configuration creates natural-sounding dynamic restoration:
- Restored natural dynamics across all frequencies
- Enhanced contrast between quiet and loud passages
- Frequency-specific control for optimal results
- Natural, musical expansion without artifacts
- Improved clarity and separation
- Reduced flatness in over-compressed recordings

### Tips for Use
- Start with the default settings for general dynamic restoration
- Adjust crossover frequencies to match your material
- Fine-tune each band's threshold based on the frequency content
- Use the gain controls to compensate for any perceived volume changes
- Monitor the expansion activity meters to ensure appropriate processing
