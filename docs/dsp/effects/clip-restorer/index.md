# Clip Restorer

Semantic type: `ClipRestorer` · Category: restoration

Reconstructs clipped waveform peaks.

## Contract

- Seeded: **no**
- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**
- Assets: **none**
- Catalog-declared latency: **sampleRateDependent**; depends on sampleRate

| Semantic name | Python constructor keyword | Type / count | Default | Unit | Range or values |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `threshold` | `threshold` | number / 1 | `-0.1` | dB | -18 … 0 |
| `outputGain` | `output_gain` | number / 1 | `-3` | dB | -12 … 0 |

## Clip Restorer

Clip Restorer reconstructs peaks that were flattened by hard digital clipping. It is useful for recordings with obvious flat-topped distortion; it cannot recover every detail that was lost before the recording reached EffeTune.

### Listening Guide

1. Start with **Threshold** at -0.10 dB and **Output Gain** at -3 dB.
2. If clearly clipped peaks remain, lower **Threshold** a little to include less extreme clipping. If loud, sustained sounds are changed unnecessarily, raise it toward 0 dB.
3. Keep **Output Gain** below 0 dB when possible. Restored peaks can be higher than the original flat peaks, so the default leaves useful headroom.
4. Use **RESTORED** while a damaged section plays, then compare with the effect bypassed to choose the least intrusive setting.

### Parameters

- **Threshold** (-18–0 dB, default -0.10 dB) sets the level treated as a clipped peak. A value closer to 0 dB targets only nearly full-scale flat peaks. Lowering it includes less obvious clipping, but can affect more loud material.
- **Output Gain** (-12–0 dB, default -3 dB) sets the output level after restoration. Raise it toward 0 dB for a louder result; lower it for more headroom if restored peaks are too high.
