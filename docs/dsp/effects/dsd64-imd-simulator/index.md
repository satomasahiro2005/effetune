# DSD64 IMD Simulator

Semantic type: `DSD64IMDSimulator` · Category: lo-fi

Models ultrasonic-noise intermodulation artifacts associated with DSD64 playback.

This type can intentionally generate output from zero input at an active setting. See [Processing model](/dsp/concepts/processing-model/#source-generating-effects).

## Contract

- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**
- Assets: **none**
- Catalog-declared latency: **zero**
- Simulation activation: **88200 Hz or higher**; lower rates are accepted and use dry passthrough
- Effective delay on the active processing path: **63 samples**

## DSD64 IMD Simulator

An effect that recreates a subtle, often-debated side effect of DSD64 playback: the ultrasonic noise that DSD carries above the audible range can, through the small imperfections of real DACs, amplifiers, and speakers, create intermodulation distortion (IMD) — extra grit and tones that fall back down into the range you can hear. This effect reproduces that audible result so you can hear and adjust it. It is a simulation and does not generate a real DSD stream.

**This effect requires a sample rate of 88.2 kHz or higher** (88.2 / 96 / 176.4 / 192 kHz). At 44.1 / 48 kHz it cannot work and is bypassed (the dry signal passes through unchanged) with a warning shown. Set the sample rate to 88.2 kHz or higher in the app's audio settings to use this effect.

### Sound Character Guide
- Very subtle "digital grit": a faint, constant sandy noise floor plus a fine harshness that follows the music.
- Demonstration tool: makes the usually-inaudible DSD64 ultrasonic IMD audible and adjustable.
- Creative texture: with higher Amount and Analog Nonlinearity it becomes an obvious lo-fi scratch/edge effect.

### Parameters

Main parameters
- **Amount** (-40.0 to +50.0 dB) - Overall level of the generated distortion.
- **Dry-Wet** (100:0 to 0:100) - Balance of dry signal to generated distortion, shown as a dry:wet ratio. 100:0 = dry only; 100:100 (center) = full dry plus full distortion; 0:100 = distortion only.
- **Ultrasonic Level** (-48.0 to -18.0 dBFS RMS) - Level of the simulated DSD ultrasonic noise. More noise produces more distortion.
- **Noise Color** (-100 to +100%) - Moves the ultrasonic noise lower or higher in frequency and tilts its balance.
- **Analog Nonlinearity** (0.00 to 10.00%) - How imperfect (non-linear) the simulated analog gear is. Higher values produce more distortion.
- **Even Bias** (0 to 100%) - Balances the make-up of the distortion. Lower values favor distortion that follows the music (Attached); higher values favor the constant, noise-like distortion (Additive) plus the Cross component.
- **Signal Coupling** (0 to 200%) - Strength of the music-dependent distortion (Attached and Cross). At 0, only the constant Additive noise remains.
- **IMD Path HPF** (0.0 to 8.0 kHz) - Limits distortion generation to frequencies above this point. 0.0 = Off (full-range, like an amplifier); around 2.5 kHz emulates a system where only the tweeter produces the distortion. The dry signal is never affected.
- **Scratch Tone** (3.0 to 14.0 kHz) - Center frequency of the audible "scratch" character.

Advanced / utility parameters
- **Noise Texture** (0 to 100%) - Adds resonant ripple to the ultrasonic noise for a slightly different texture.
- **Cross Sideband** (0 to 100%) - Amount of distortion created by the music mixing with the ultrasonic noise.
- **Output Trim** (-24.0 to +12.0 dB) - Final output level adjustment.

### Recommended Settings
- Subtle (default): Amount +24 dB, Ultrasonic Level -30 dBFS, Analog Nonlinearity 1.40%, Even Bias 20%, Signal Coupling 150%, Cross Sideband 75%, Scratch Tone 10.5 kHz.
- Tweeter-only IMD: IMD Path HPF 2.5 kHz, Signal Coupling 80–150%, Cross Sideband 50–100%, Scratch Tone 9–14 kHz.
- Obvious effect: raise Amount, Ultrasonic Level, and Analog Nonlinearity.
