## 5Band PEQ

A flexible 5-band equalizer for shaping music playback. Use it when bass feels boomy, vocals sound harsh, or the highs need a little more sparkle without opening the more detailed 15-band version.

### Sound Enhancement Guide
- Vocal and Instrument Clarity:
  - Use the 3.16kHz band with moderate Q (1.0-2.0) for natural presence
  - Apply narrow Q (4.0-8.0) cuts only when a specific resonance is bothering you
  - Add gentle air with the 10kHz high shelf (+2 to +4dB)
- Bass Quality Control:
  - Shape bass fullness with the 100Hz peaking filter
  - Use a narrow cut if one bass note or room boom stands out too much
  - Create smooth bass extension with low shelf
- Everyday Sound Tuning:
  - Use broad, small adjustments for natural tone changes
  - Reduce harshness, boominess, or dullness by ear
  - Compare with bypass often so the music still sounds balanced

### Parameters
- **Five Adjustable Bands**
  - Band 1: 100Hz (Sub & Bass Control)
  - Band 2: 316Hz (Lower Midrange Definition)
  - Band 3: 1.0kHz (Midrange Presence)
  - Band 4: 3.2kHz (Upper Midrange Detail)
  - Band 5: 10kHz (High Frequency Extension)
- **Controls Per Band**
  - Center Frequency: Adjustable from 20Hz to 20kHz
  - Gain Range: ±20dB for Peaking and Low/High Shelf filters
  - Q Factor: 0.1-10.0 for most filter types; Low/High Shelf is limited to 0.1-2.0
  - Higher Q affects a narrower range; lower Q sounds smoother and broader
  - For Low/High Pass, Band Pass, Notch, and AllPass, Frequency and Q shape the filter; Gain is not used
  - Multiple Filter Types:
    - Peaking: Symmetrical frequency adjustment
    - Low/High Pass: 12dB/octave slope
    - Low/High Shelf: Gentle spectral shaping
    - Band Pass: Focused frequency isolation
    - Notch: Precise frequency removal
    - AllPass: Phase-focused frequency alignment
