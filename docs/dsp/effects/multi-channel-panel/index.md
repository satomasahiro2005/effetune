# Multi Channel Panel

Semantic type: `MultiChannelPanel` · Category: basics

Applies per-channel gain, mute, solo, and delay controls to multichannel audio.

This type has catalog telemetry metadata but no public observation API. See [Compatibility](/dsp/reference/compatibility/#analyzers-and-telemetry).

## Contract

- Seeded: **no**
- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**
- Assets: **none**
- Catalog-declared latency: **zero**
- Telemetry: **catalog metadata only; no public observation API**

## MultiChannel Panel

A comprehensive control panel for managing multiple audio channels individually. This plugin provides complete control over volume, muting, soloing, and delay for up to 16 channels, with a visual level meter for each channel.

Scroll within the panel to reach channels below the visible area.

### When to Use
- When working with multi-channel audio (up to 16 channels)
- To create custom volume balance between different channels
- When you need to apply individual delay to specific channels
- For monitoring levels across multiple channels simultaneously

### Features
- Individual controls for up to 16 audio channels
- Real-time level meters with peak hold for visual monitoring
- Channel linking capability for grouped parameter changes

### Parameters

#### Per Channel Controls
- **Mute (M)** - Silences individual channels
  - Toggle on/off for each channel
  - Works in conjunction with solo feature

- **Solo (S)** - Isolates individual channels
  - When any channel is soloed, only soloed channels play
  - Multiple channels can be soloed simultaneously

- **Volume** - Adjusts individual channel loudness (-20dB to +10dB)
  - Fine control with slider or direct value input
  - Linked channels maintain the same volume

- **Delay** - Adds time delay to individual channels (0-30ms)
  - Precise delay control in milliseconds
  - Useful for time-alignment between channels
  - Allows phase adjustment between channels

#### Channel Linking
- **Link** - Connects adjacent channels for synchronized control
  - Changes to one linked channel affect all connected channels
  - Maintains consistent settings across linked channel groups
  - Useful for stereo pairs or multi-channel groups

### Practical Applications
- Balancing surround sound or multi-speaker playback
- Matching speaker timing when speakers are at different distances
- Temporarily muting or soloing individual speakers during setup
- Linking stereo pairs or speaker groups for easier adjustment
