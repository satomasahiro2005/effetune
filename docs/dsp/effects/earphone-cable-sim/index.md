## Earphone Cable Sim

Reproduces the small frequency-response shifts that appear when an earphone is driven by an amplifier through real cable resistance/inductance and non-zero output impedance. Because an earphone's impedance varies with frequency (driver resonances plus voice-coil inductance), source and cable impedance create earphone-specific level changes. This is useful as a reality check: with cables of normal construction and quality, ordinary amplifier output impedance, and earphones that are not unusually low in impedance or otherwise abnormal, the audible change from ordinary earphone-cable differences is generally small enough to be negligible. The effect is strongest with low-impedance earphones that have large impedance peaks, and is usually subtle with modern low-output-impedance amplifiers.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Evaluate Source-Impedance Interaction:
  - Raise Output Z to emulate tube amps or high-impedance headphone outputs
  - Compare with bypass to hear how bass and impedance-peak regions change
- Explore Multi-Driver Earphone Behavior:
  - Enable additional Resonances to model balanced-armature or hybrid earphones with multiple impedance peaks
  - Larger impedance peaks combined with higher source impedance create stronger coloration
- Simulate Cable Resistance and Inductance:
  - Increase Cable R to emulate longer or thinner cables with higher DC resistance
  - Increase Cable L to emulate higher-inductance cables; its effect is mainly in the upper treble
  - Cable R adds to the total series resistance, so it can strengthen the interaction across the band
- Check Normal Cable Audibility:
  - Use realistic Cable R and Cable L values, then compare with bypass to estimate how small ordinary cable differences are
  - If only extreme Output Z, Cable R, or very low Base Z settings make the change obvious, the same comparison suggests normal cables are unlikely to be audibly significant with that earphone and amplifier

### System Presets

Click **Effect Presets** in the effect header to compare complete source-and-cable cases.

- **High Impedance Source** - A high-output-impedance source driving a low-impedance earphone.
- **Long Thin Cable** - Increased cable resistance and inductance.
- **Vintage Portable Out** - A higher-impedance portable output and 32 Ω earphone.

### Parameters
- **Output Z (Ω)** - Amplifier output impedance (0 to 20). Values below 1Ω are typical of modern amplifiers; higher values make impedance-related coloration stronger.
- **Cable R (Ω)** - Cable DC resistance (0 to 2). Higher values represent longer or thinner cables and add to the total series resistance.
- **Cable L (µH)** - Cable inductance (0 to 5). Mainly affects upper-treble response, especially with low-impedance earphones.
- **Voice Coil L (mH)** - Earphone voice-coil inductance (0.01 to 2). Raises load impedance toward high frequencies and changes the high-frequency interaction.
- **Base Z (Ω)** - Nominal earphone impedance at low frequencies (4 to 64). Lower values make source and cable impedance more influential.
- **Resonances (up to 5)** - Each models one impedance peak of the driver. The first is enabled by default; the rest are pre-set to typical driver resonances and can be toggled on.
  - **Enable** - Turn each resonance on or off
  - **Freq (Hz)** - Resonance frequency (20 to 20000)
  - **Q** - Sharpness of the impedance peak (0.5 to 10)
  - **Peak Z (Ω)** - Impedance at the resonance peak (16 to 116)

### Technical Details
- **Physical Model**: Computes `H(f) = Zload / (Zsource + Zload)`, where `Zsource` is the output impedance plus cable resistance/inductance and `Zload` is the earphone impedance (base impedance, voice-coil inductance, and resonance peaks).
- **Realization**: The transfer function is factored and converted to a matched-Z cascade of biquad filters, giving zero latency and minimum-phase behavior comparable to the other EQ plugins.
- **Normalization**: The response is normalized to a 0 dB power average (20Hz to 20kHz) so toggling the effect does not change overall loudness.
