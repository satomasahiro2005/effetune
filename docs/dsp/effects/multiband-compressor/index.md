## Multiband Compressor

A five-band listening processor that balances loudness separately in different frequency ranges. Use it when bass jumps out, vocals feel too forward, or treble becomes sharp. The default settings create a steady, radio-like sound for casual listening.

### Key Features
- 5-band processing with adjustable crossover frequencies
- Independent compression controls for each band
- Optimized default settings for FM radio-style sound
- Real-time visualization of gain reduction per band
- High-quality Linkwitz-Riley crossover filters

### Default Frequency Bands
The crossover frequencies are adjustable; these are the default band ranges.

- Band 1 (Low): Below 100 Hz
  - Controls the deep bass and sub frequencies
  - Higher ratio and longer release for tight, controlled bass
- Band 2 (Low-Mid): 100-500 Hz
  - Handles the upper bass and lower midrange
  - Moderate compression to maintain warmth
- Band 3 (Mid): 500-2000 Hz
  - Critical vocal and instrument presence range
  - Gentle compression to preserve naturalness
- Band 4 (High-Mid): 2000-8000 Hz
  - Controls presence and air
  - Light compression with faster response
- Band 5 (High): Above 8000 Hz
  - Manages brightness and sparkle
  - Quick response times with higher ratio

### Parameters

#### Crossover Frequencies
- **Freq 1** (20Hz to 500Hz, default 100Hz)
  - Sets the Low/Low-Mid crossover point
- **Freq 2** (100Hz to 2000Hz, default 500Hz)
  - Sets the Low-Mid/Mid crossover point
- **Freq 3** (500Hz to 8000Hz, default 2000Hz)
  - Sets the Mid/High-Mid crossover point
- **Freq 4** (1000Hz to 20000Hz, default 8000Hz)
  - Sets the High-Mid/High crossover point
- Frequencies are kept in ascending order automatically, so moving one control can raise the next crossover if needed

#### Per-Band Controls
- **Threshold** (-60dB to 0dB)
  - Sets the level where compression begins
  - Lower settings create more consistent levels
- **Ratio** (0.5:1 to 20:1)
  - 1:1: No change
  - Above 1:1: Compresses loud parts in that band
  - Below 1:1: Boosts sounds above the threshold for a more emphasized band sound
  - For normal listening control, start around 2:1 to 5:1
- **Attack** (0.1ms to 100ms)
  - How quickly compression responds
  - Faster times for transient control
- **Release** (10ms to 1000ms)
  - How quickly gain returns to normal
  - Longer times for smoother sound
- **Knee** (0dB to 12dB)
  - Smoothness of compression onset
  - Higher values for more natural transition
- **Gain** (-12dB to +12dB)
  - Output level adjustment per band
  - Fine-tune the frequency balance

### FM Radio Style Processing
The Multiband Compressor comes with optimized default settings for a steady FM radio-style listening sound:

- Low Band (< 100 Hz)
  - Higher ratio (4:1) for tight bass control
  - Slower attack/release to maintain punch
  - Slight reduction to prevent muddiness

- Low-Mid Band (100-500 Hz)
  - Moderate compression (3:1)
  - Balanced timing for natural response
  - Neutral gain to keep the low-mid balance natural

- Mid Band (500-2000 Hz)
  - Gentle compression (2.5:1)
  - Quick response times
  - Slight boost for vocal presence

- High-Mid Band (2000-8000 Hz)
  - Light compression (2:1)
  - Fast attack/release
  - Enhanced presence boost

- High Band (> 8000 Hz)
  - Higher ratio (5:1) for consistent brilliance
  - Very quick response times
  - Controlled reduction for polish

This configuration creates the characteristic "radio-ready" sound:
- Consistent, impactful bass
- Clear, forward vocals
- Controlled dynamics across all frequencies
- Smoother, more polished overall presentation
- Enhanced presence and clarity
- Reduced listening fatigue

### Tips for Use
- Start with the default FM radio-style settings
- Adjust crossover frequencies to match your material
- Fine-tune each band's threshold for desired amount of control
- Use the gain controls to shape the final frequency balance
- Monitor the gain reduction meters to ensure appropriate processing
