## Click Remover

Click Remover repairs short, isolated faults such as record crackle, pops, brief clicks, and tiny dropouts. Use it for occasional interruptions rather than for a constant hiss or hum.

### Listening Guide

1. Start with **Sensitivity** at 50% and **Max Repair Length** at 1 ms.
2. Raise **Sensitivity** gradually until the unwanted clicks become less noticeable. If drum hits or other sharp musical details become softer, lower it again.
3. Increase **Max Repair Length** only when the faults last longer than a brief click. Keep it short for ordinary crackle.
4. While the affected passage plays, use **REPAIRS/S** to confirm that the effect is finding faults; compare with the effect bypassed before keeping a stronger setting.

### Parameters

- **Sensitivity** (0–100%, default 50%) controls how readily the effect treats a short change as a fault. Higher values repair more suspected clicks; lower values are more conservative and better preserve sharp musical attacks.
- **Max Repair Length** (0.1–2 ms, default 1 ms) limits the duration of each repair. Raise it for slightly longer pops or dropouts; lower it when repairing ordinary short crackle.
