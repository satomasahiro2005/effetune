# Channel Divider

Semantic type: `ChannelDivider` · Category: basics

Routes an input channel into selected output channels according to its semantic parameters.

## Channel Divider

A specialized tool that splits your stereo signal into separate frequency bands and routes each band to a different stereo output pair. It is useful for multi-amplifier, multi-speaker, or custom crossover playback setups.

To use this effect, use the desktop app, set an even output-channel count from 4 to 16 in the audio settings, and set the channel in the effect bus routing to "All." The selected Band Count determines which output pairs the effect uses.

### When to Use
- When using even multi-channel audio outputs from 4 to 16 channels
- To create custom frequency-based channel routing
- For multi-amplifier or multi-speaker setups

### Parameters
- **Band Count** - Number of frequency bands to create (2-4 bands)
  - 2 bands: Low/High split, requiring 4 output channels
  - 3 bands: Low/Mid/High split, requiring 6 output channels
  - 4 bands: Low/Mid-Low/Mid-High/High split, requiring 8 output channels
  - Band Count remains limited to four bands; higher output-channel counts do not add more bands

- **Crossover Frequencies** - Define where audio splits between bands
  - F1: First crossover point
  - F2: Second crossover point (for 3+ bands)
  - F3: Third crossover point (for 4 bands)
  - Each crossover can be set from 10 Hz to 40000 Hz
  - The plugin keeps F1, F2, and F3 in ascending order with at least 1 Hz separation

- **Slopes** - Control how sharply bands are separated
  - Options: -12dB to -96dB per octave
  - Steeper slopes provide cleaner separation
  - Lower slopes offer more natural transitions

### Technical Notes
- Processes first two input channels only
- Output channels must be an even number from 4 to 16
- Each band keeps the original stereo pair: 2-band mode outputs Low to channels 1-2 and High to channels 3-4; 3-band mode uses channels 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6; 4-band mode uses channels 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8
- Uses high-quality Linkwitz-Riley crossover filters
