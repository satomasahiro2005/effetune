## Tilt EQ

A simple yet effective equalizer that gently tilts the frequency balance of your music. It's designed for subtle adjustments, making your music sound warmer or brighter without complex controls. Ideal for quickly tailoring the overall tone to your preference.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Make Music Warmer:
  - Use negative slope values to reduce high frequencies and increase low frequencies.
  - Perfect for bright recordings or headphones that sound too sharp.
  - Creates a cozy and relaxed listening experience.
- Make Music Brighter:
  - Use positive slope values to increase high frequencies and reduce low frequencies.
  - Ideal for dull recordings or speakers that sound muffled.
  - Adds clarity and sparkle to your music.
- Subtle Tone Adjustments:
  - Use small slope values for gentle overall tone shaping.
  - Fine-tune the balance to match your listening environment or mood.

### Parameters
- **Pivot Frequency** - Controls the center frequency of the tilt (20Hz to ~20kHz)
  - Adjust to set the frequency point around which the tilt occurs.
- **Slope** - Controls the steepness of the tilt around the Pivot Frequency (-12 dB/oct to +12 dB/oct)
  - Positive values make the sound brighter; negative values make it warmer.
  - Smaller values make gentler changes.
