# Note Spectrogram

Semantic type: `NoteSpectrogram` · Category: analyzer

Passes audio through while exposing detected pitch confidence across the 88-key piano range at five positions per semitone.

Use the opt-in decoded telemetry callback or subscription API to observe this effect. See [Compatibility](/dsp/reference/compatibility/#analyzers-and-telemetry).

## Note Spectrogram

Shows estimated fundamental pitches (F0s) in a selectable range from A0 to C8 in a scrolling piano roll without changing the audio. Use it to follow chord tones, changing vocal and melodic lines, bass lines, and notes that overlap across octaves.

### Visualization Guide

- **Vertical** shows time from left to right, with the keyboard and current sound at the right edge. Higher notes appear toward the top.
- **Horizontal** places the keyboard at the bottom, with low notes on the left and high notes on the right. New sound appears just above the keyboard, and history scrolls upward.
- Lines at each C mark octave boundaries.
- Pitch rows corresponding to black piano keys use a nearly black gray background so they remain distinguishable when no note is detected.
- **Normal** uses the theme’s graph trace color; **Note Colors** uses a different color for each note, repeated across octaves. The guide lines between E and F remain visible in both modes.
- **1/12 Octave** shows one row per semitone. **High (1/60 Octave)** divides each semitone into five rows so that small pitch movement is easier to follow; colors are blended between neighboring notes.
- Color strength follows the model’s confidence, including weak candidates without a display threshold. Confidence indicates how strongly the model supports a pitch; it is not a calibrated probability.
- With **Volume** on, each detected pitch becomes a bar whose opaque core thickness shows its frequency-corrected relative volume, from 1/60 octave at the bottom of the scale to 1/12 octave at the top. A fade extends 1/120 octave beyond each side of that core, adding 1/60 octave to the total footprint. **Pitch Resolution** changes the bar’s center position, not its core thickness.
- At the keyboard edge, a soft-edged semicircle extends into the graph and shows the current volume. It responds immediately to increases and falls at 20 dB per second; there is no separate visible peak hold.
- The volume scale covers 24 dB. Its top follows the louder of a recent reference used to stabilize the history scale (over about one second) and -36 dB, so quieter material remains readable without making louder passages fill the display continuously. This reference is separate from the current-volume semicircle.
- Octave and E–F guide lines are drawn behind the volume bars so the pitch grid remains a visual reference.
- The keys blend from their normal color toward the display color as confidence in the latest frame increases, reaching that color at 1.
- Changing **Color** recolors the existing history.

### Listening Guide

- Chords appear as several bright rows at the same time
- Melodies and bass lines form paths that move between note rows
- The display estimates pitch; it does not create MIDI or notation, identify instruments, or separate every simultaneous sound completely. Complex overlaps can leave parts of a melody or harmony blank, while percussion, noise, and unclear repeating patterns can produce an occasional incorrect pitch.

### Parameters

- **Color** - Selects the display colors without changing the pitch estimates.
  - **Normal** (default): the theme’s graph trace color.
  - **Note Colors**: a separate color for each note, repeated across octaves.
- **Pitch Resolution** - Selects the vertical pitch detail without clearing the existing history.
  - **1/12 Octave** (default): one row per semitone, using the strongest estimate within that note.
  - **High (1/60 Octave)**: five rows per semitone for finer pitch movement.
- **Layout** - Selects **Horizontal** (default) or **Vertical**. Switching layout preserves the existing history.
- **Volume** - Shows relative volume in bar thickness and semicircle meters. It is on by default; turning it off shows confidence as row intensity.
- **Time Span** (1 to 10 s) - Sets how much time the piano roll shows
  - Shorter values make timing changes easier to see
  - Longer values show a longer musical passage at once
  - Default: 2 s
- **Regular Note Limit** (1 to 16 notes) - Sets how many simultaneous notes outside the dedicated low-note range can reach the final detection stage. The default is 8. Increase it for unusually dense chords; lower values reduce analysis work and competition between candidates.
- **Lowest Note** - Sets the bottom of both the displayed and analyzed pitch range. Default: E1.
- **Highest Note** - Sets the top of both the displayed and analyzed pitch range. Default: G6.
- When input is too low for analysis, the piano roll remains dark rather than showing extremely small input as pitches. This suppression does not determine whether a sound would be audible or perceptually masked.
