## 15Band PEQ

A 15-band parametric equalizer for fine-tuning bass, vocals, presence, and treble while listening. Use it when you want more detailed control than a graphic EQ, from small tone changes to narrowing down a specific annoying frequency.

### Sound Enhancement Guide
- Vocal and Instrument Clarity:
  - Set one band to around 3.2kHz with moderate Q (1.0-2.0) for natural presence
  - Apply narrow Q (4.0-8.0) cuts only when a specific resonance is bothering you
  - Add gentle air with a 10kHz high shelf (+2 to +4dB)
- Bass Quality Control:
  - Shape bass fullness with a 100Hz peaking filter
  - Use a narrow cut if one bass note or room boom stands out too much
  - Create smooth bass extension with a low shelf
- Fine Listening Adjustments:
  - Use small, broad boosts or cuts for natural results
  - Use narrow settings for targeted problems rather than overall tone
  - Compare with bypass often so the music still sounds balanced

### Parameters
- **Configurable Bands**
  - 15 fully configurable frequency bands
  - Initial frequency settings:
    - 25Hz, 40Hz, 63Hz, 100Hz, 160Hz (Deep Bass)
    - 250Hz, 400Hz, 630Hz (Lower Sound)
    - 1kHz, 1.6kHz, 2.5kHz (Middle Sound)
    - 4kHz, 6.3kHz, 10kHz, 16kHz (High Sound)
- **Controls Per Band**
  - Center Frequency: Adjustable from 20Hz to 20kHz
  - Gain Range: ±20dB for Peaking and Low/High Shelf filters
  - Q Factor: 0.1-10.0 for most filter types; Low/High Shelf is limited to 0.1-2.0
  - Higher Q affects a narrower range; lower Q sounds smoother and broader
  - For Low/High Pass, Band Pass, Notch, and AllPass, Frequency and Q shape the filter; Gain is not used
  - Multiple Filter Types:
    - Peaking: Symmetrical frequency adjustment
    - Low/High Pass: 12dB/octave slope
    - Low/High Shelf: Gentle spectral shaping
    - Band Pass: Focused frequency isolation
    - Notch: Precise frequency removal
    - AllPass: Phase-focused frequency alignment
- **Preset Management**
  - Import: Load Equalizer APO-style TXT filter lines
  - Up to 15 `ON` PK/LS/LSC/HS/HSC filters are imported; `Preamp` lines and unsupported filter types are ignored
    - Example format:
      ```
      Filter 1: ON PK Fc 50 Hz Gain -3.0 dB Q 2.00
      Filter 2: ON HS Fc 12000 Hz Gain 4.0 dB Q 0.70
      ...
      ```
