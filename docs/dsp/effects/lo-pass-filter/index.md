## Lo Pass Filter

A precision low-pass filter that removes unwanted high frequencies while preserving the warmth and body of lower frequencies. Based on Linkwitz-Riley filter design for optimal phase response and transparent sound quality.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Reduce Harshness and Sibilance:
  - Set frequency between 8-12kHz to tame harsh recordings
  - Use moderate slopes (-12dB/oct to -24dB/oct) for natural sound
  - Helps reduce listening fatigue with bright recordings
- Warm Up Digital Recordings:
  - Set frequency between 12-16kHz to reduce digital "edge"
  - Use gentle slopes (-12dB/oct) for subtle warming effect
  - Creates a more analog-like sound character
- Create Special Effects:
  - Set frequency between 1-3kHz with a steep slope for a muffled, narrow-band character
  - Use steep slopes (-48dB/oct or higher) for dramatic filtering
  - For a vintage radio effect, combine with Hi Pass Filter to remove low frequencies as well
- Control Noise and Hiss:
  - Set frequency just above the musical content (typically 14-18kHz)
  - Use steeper slopes (-36dB/oct or higher) for effective noise control
  - Reduces tape hiss or background noise while preserving most musical content

### Parameters
- **Frequency (Hz)** - Controls where high frequencies are filtered out (10Hz to 40000Hz; the effective upper limit also depends on the audio sample rate)
  - Lower values: More high frequencies are removed
  - Higher values: Only the very highest frequencies are removed
  - Adjust based on the specific high-frequency content you want to eliminate
- **Slope** - Controls how aggressively frequencies above the cutoff are reduced
  - Off: No filtering applied
  - -12dB/oct: Gentle filtering (LR2 - 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -24dB/oct: Standard filtering (LR4 - 4th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -36dB/oct: Stronger filtering (LR6 - 6th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -48dB/oct: Very strong filtering (LR8 - 8th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -60dB/oct to -96dB/oct: Extremely steep filtering for special applications
