# Auto Leveler

Semantic type: `AutoLeveler` · Category: dynamics

Adjusts gain gradually toward a configured target level.

This type has catalog telemetry metadata but no public observation API. See [Compatibility](/dsp/reference/compatibility/#analyzers-and-telemetry).

## Contract

- Seeded: **no**
- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**
- Assets: **none**
- Catalog-declared latency: **zero**
- Telemetry: **catalog metadata only; no public observation API**

## Auto Leveler

A smart volume control that automatically adjusts your music to maintain a consistent listening level. It uses a LUFS-style level estimate to keep playback closer to your chosen target, whether you're listening to quiet classical pieces or dynamic pop songs.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Classical Music:
  - Enjoy both quiet passages and loud crescendos without touching the volume
  - Hear all the subtle details in piano pieces
  - Perfect for albums with varying recording levels
- Pop/Rock Music:
  - Keep a consistent volume across different songs
  - No more surprises from overly loud or quiet tracks
  - Comfortable listening during long sessions
- Background Music:
  - Maintain steady volume while working or studying
  - Never too loud or too quiet
  - Perfect for playlists with mixed content

### Parameters

- **Target** (-36.0dB to 0.0dB LUFS)
  - Sets your desired listening level
  - Default -18.0dB LUFS is comfortable for most music
  - Lower values for quieter background listening
  - Higher values for more impactful sound

- **Time Window** (1000ms to 10000ms)
  - How quickly the level is measured
  - Shorter times: More responsive to changes
  - Longer times: More stable, natural sound
  - Default 3000ms works well for most music

- **Max Gain** (0.0dB to 12.0dB)
  - Limits how much quiet sounds are boosted
  - Higher values: More consistent volume
  - Lower values: More natural dynamics
  - Start with 6.0dB for gentle control

- **Min Gain** (-36.0dB to 0.0dB)
  - Limits how much loud sounds are reduced
  - Higher values: More natural sound
  - Lower values: More consistent volume
  - Try -12.0dB as a starting point

- **Attack Time** (1ms to 1000ms)
  - How quickly volume is reduced
  - Faster times: Better control of sudden loud sounds
  - Slower times: More natural transitions
  - Default 50ms balances control and naturalness

- **Release Time** (10ms to 10000ms)
  - How quickly volume returns to normal
  - Faster times: More responsive
  - Slower times: Smoother transitions
  - Default 5000ms for smooth, natural level changes

- **Noise Gate** (-96dB to -24dB)
  - Prevents very quiet passages or background noise from being boosted
  - Higher values: Less boosting of quiet background noise
  - Lower values: Allows the leveler to react to quieter passages
  - Start at -60dB and adjust if needed
