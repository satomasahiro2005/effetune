## Sub Synth

A specialized effect that reinforces the low end by mixing in a filtered low-frequency signal derived from the original audio. Useful when bass-light music needs more warmth, fullness, or headphone-friendly impact.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Bass Enhancement:
  - Adds depth and power to thin recordings
  - Creates fuller, richer low end
  - Perfect for headphone listening
- Frequency Control:
  - Control which added low-frequency range is kept
  - Independent filtering for clean bass
  - Maintains clarity while adding power

### Parameters
- **Sub Level** - Controls the added low-frequency signal level (0-200%)
  - Light (0-50%): Subtle bass enhancement
  - Medium (50-100%): Balanced bass boost
  - High (100-200%): Dramatic bass effect
- **Dry Level** - Adjusts the original signal level (0-200%)
  - Use to balance with the added low-frequency signal
  - Maintain clarity of original sound
- **Sub LPF** - Low-pass filter for the added low-frequency signal (5-400Hz)
  - Frequency: Controls upper limit of the added low-frequency signal
  - Slope: Adjusts filter steepness (Off to -24dB/oct)
- **Sub HPF** - High-pass filter for the added low-frequency signal (5-400Hz)
  - Frequency: Removes unwanted rumble from the added low-frequency signal
  - Slope: Controls filter steepness (Off to -24dB/oct)
- **Dry HPF** - High-pass filter for dry signal (5-400Hz)
  - Frequency: Prevents bass buildup
  - Slope: Adjusts filter steepness (Off to -24dB/oct)

### Music Enhancement Tips
- For General Bass Enhancement:
  1. Start with Sub Level at 50%
  2. Set Sub LPF around 100Hz (-12dB/oct)
  3. Keep Sub HPF at 20Hz (-6dB/oct)
  4. Adjust Dry Level to taste

- For Clean Bass Boost:
  1. Set Sub Level to 70-100%
  2. Use Sub LPF at 80Hz (-18dB/oct)
  3. Set Sub HPF to 30Hz (-12dB/oct)
  4. Set Dry HPF to 40Hz (-6dB/oct)

- For Maximum Impact:
  1. Increase Sub Level to 150%
  2. Set Sub LPF to 120Hz (-24dB/oct)
  3. Keep Sub HPF at 15Hz (-6dB/oct)
  4. Balance with Dry Level

### Quick Start Guide
1. Start with moderate Sub Level (50-70%)
2. Set Sub LPF around 100Hz
3. Enable Sub HPF around 20Hz (-6dB/oct)
4. Adjust Dry Level for balance
5. Fine-tune filters to taste
6. Trust your ears and adjust gradually!
