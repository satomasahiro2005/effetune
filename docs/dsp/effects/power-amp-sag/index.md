## Power Amp Sag

Simulates the voltage sag behavior of power amplifiers under high load conditions. This effect creates amplifier-like dynamic compression by gently dipping the level on demanding musical passages, then recovering as the passage relaxes.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Vintage Audio Systems:
  - Recreates classic amplifier character with natural compression
  - Adds gentle amplifier-like compression to loud passages
  - Useful when you want a softer, less rigid response on peaks
- Rock/Pop Music:
  - Enhances punch and presence during powerful passages
  - Adds natural compression without harshness
  - Creates a slight level dip and recovery on powerful sections
- Classical Music:
  - Gently softens orchestral crescendos without hard limiting
  - Softens strong string and brass peaks
  - Enhances realism of amplified performances
- Jazz Music:
  - Recreates classic amplifier compression behavior
  - Adds subtle compression movement to solo-focused recordings
  - Maintains natural dynamic flow

### System Presets

Click **Effect Presets** in the effect header to start with a complete power-supply behavior.

- **Vintage Tube Sag** - Deep sag and slow recovery.
- **Modern Monoblocks** - A stable independent-supply response.
- **Pushed Combo** - A strong shared-supply dip and recovery.

### Parameters

- **Sensitivity** (-18.0dB to +18.0dB)
  - Controls how sensitive the sag effect is to input levels
  - Higher values: More sag at lower volumes
  - Lower values: Only affects loud signals
  - Start with 0dB for natural response

- **Stability** (0% to 100%)
  - Simulates power supply capacitance size
  - Lower values: Smaller capacitors (more dramatic sag)
  - Higher values: Larger capacitors (more stable voltage)
  - Physically represents the energy storage capacity of the power supply
  - 50% provides balanced character

- **Recovery Speed** (0% to 100%)
  - Controls the power supply's recharge capability
  - Lower values: Slower recharge rate (sustained compression)
  - Higher values: Faster recharge rate (quicker recovery)
  - Physically represents the charging circuit's current delivery capability
  - 40% provides natural behavior

- **Monoblock** (Checkbox)
  - Enables independent processing per channel
  - Unchecked: Shared power supply (stereo amplifier)
  - Checked: Independent supplies (monoblock configuration)
  - Use for better channel separation and imaging

### Recommended Settings

#### Vintage Character
- Sensitivity: +3.0dB
- Stability: 30% (smaller capacitors)
- Recovery Speed: 25% (slower recharge)
- Monoblock: Unchecked

#### Modern Hi-Fi Enhancement
- Sensitivity: 0.0dB
- Stability: 70% (larger capacitors)
- Recovery Speed: 60% (faster recharge)
- Monoblock: Checked

#### Dynamic Rock/Pop
- Sensitivity: +6.0dB
- Stability: 40% (moderate capacitors)
- Recovery Speed: 50% (moderate recharge)
- Monoblock: Unchecked
