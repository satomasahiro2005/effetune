## Level Meter

A visual display that shows your music's digital signal level in real time. It helps you check levels after applying effects and spot possible clipping before it becomes audible distortion.

### Visualization Guide
- The horizontal bar extends farther to the right as the signal level gets louder
- The white marker holds a new peak for one second, then falls smoothly
- OVERLOAD means the signal exceeded the safe digital range and may distort
- For clean playback, avoid frequent red levels or OVERLOAD warnings; set your actual listening volume on your device
