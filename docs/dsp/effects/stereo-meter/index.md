# Stereo Meter

Semantic type: `StereoMeter` · Category: analyzer

Passes audio through while the host-side EffeTune app can display stereo level and phase relationships.

Use the opt-in decoded telemetry callback or subscription API to observe this effect. See [Compatibility](/dsp/reference/compatibility/#analyzers-and-telemetry).

## Contract

- Seeded: **no**
- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**
- Assets: **none**
- Catalog-declared latency: **zero**
- Telemetry: **decoded semantic observations are available**

| Semantic name | Python constructor keyword | Type / count | Default | Unit | Range or values |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `windowTime` | `window_time` | number / 1 | `0.1` | s | 0.01 … 1 |

## Stereo Meter

A fascinating visualization tool that lets you see how your music creates a sense of space through stereo sound. Watch how different instruments and sounds move between your speakers or headphones, adding an exciting visual dimension to your listening experience.

### Visualization Guide
- **Diamond Display** - The main window where the music comes to life:
  - Center: Very quiet moments or moments where the combined signal is near zero
  - Top/Bottom: Sound shared by left and right channels, such as centered or mono-like content
  - Left/Right: Difference or out-of-phase content between the channels
  - Sounds that are much stronger on one side can appear toward the labeled corners
  - Green dots dance with the current music
  - White line traces the musical peaks
  - The white peak line decays with every audio sample, so its movement stays consistent regardless of the audio processing block size
- **Correlation Bar** (Left side)
  - Shows left/right channel correlation
  - Top (+1.0): Left and right are nearly the same, often sounding centered
  - Middle (0.0): Weak channel relationship, often from wide ambience or unrelated left/right content
  - Bottom (-1.0): Left and right are nearly opposite polarity, which can sound weak on speakers
- **Balance Bar** (Bottom)
  - Shows if one speaker is louder than the other
  - Center: Music equally loud in both speakers
  - Left/Right: Music stronger in one speaker
  - Numbers show how much louder in decibels (dB)

### What You Can See
- **Centered Sound**: Strong vertical movement in the middle
- **Spacious Sound**: Activity spread wide across the display
- **Special Effects**: Interesting patterns in the corners
- **Speaker Balance**: Where the bottom bar points
- **Channel Correlation**: What the left correlation bar shows

### Parameters
- **Window** (10-1000 ms) - How much recent audio is shown in the display
  - Lower values: See quick musical changes
  - Higher values: See overall sound patterns
  - Default: 100 ms works well for most music
- **Gain** (0-24 dB; default 0 dB) - Enlarges only the dots and peak line in the diamond. Raise it to see quieter patterns more clearly. It does not change the sound or the correlation and balance readings.

### Enjoying Your Music
1. **Watch Different Styles**
   - Classical music often shows gentle, balanced patterns
   - Electronic music might create wild, spreading designs
   - Live recordings can show natural room movement

2. **Discover Sound Qualities**
   - See how different albums use stereo effects
   - Notice how some songs feel wider than others
   - Observe how instruments move between speakers

3. **Enhance Your Experience**
   - Try different headphones to see how they show stereo
   - Compare old and new recordings of your favorite songs
   - Watch how different listening positions change the display

Remember: These tools are meant to enhance your enjoyment of music by adding a visual dimension to your listening experience. Have fun exploring and discovering new ways to see your favorite music!
