## Narrow Range

A tool that lets you focus on specific parts of the music by filtering out unwanted frequencies. Useful for creating special sound effects or removing unwanted sounds.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Create unique sound effects:
  - "Telephone voice" effect
  - "Old radio" sound
  - "Underwater" effect
- Focus on a frequency range:
  - Make bass-heavy parts easier to hear
  - Focus on vocal range
  - Narrow the sound to the range where vocals or instruments are most noticeable
- Remove unwanted sounds:
  - Reduce low-frequency rumble
  - Cut excessive high-frequency hiss
  - Focus on the range you want to hear most clearly

### Parameters
- **HPF Frequency** - Controls where low sounds start being reduced (20Hz to 4000Hz)
  - Higher values: Removes more bass
  - Lower values: Keeps more bass
  - Start with low values and adjust to taste
- **HPF Slope** - How quickly low sounds are reduced (0 to -48 dB/octave)
  - 0dB: No reduction (off)
  - -6dB to -48dB: Increasingly stronger reduction in 6dB steps
- **LPF Frequency** - Controls where high sounds start being reduced (200Hz to 40000Hz)
  - Lower values: Removes more highs
  - Higher values: Keeps more highs
  - Start high and adjust down as needed
- **LPF Slope** - How quickly high sounds are reduced (0 to -48 dB/octave)
  - 0dB: No reduction (off)
  - -6dB to -48dB: Increasingly stronger reduction in 6dB steps
