## Band Pass Filter

A precision band-pass filter that combines high-pass and low-pass filters to allow only frequencies in a specific range to pass through. Based on Linkwitz-Riley filter design for optimal phase response and transparent sound quality.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Focus on Vocal Range:
  - Set HPF between 100-300Hz and LPF between 4-8kHz to emphasize vocal clarity
  - Use moderate slopes (-24dB/oct) for natural sound
  - Helps vocals stand out in complex mixes
- Create Special Effects:
  - Set narrow frequency ranges for telephone, radio, or megaphone effects
  - Use steeper slopes (-36dB/oct or higher) for more dramatic filtering
  - Experiment with different frequency ranges for creative sounds
- Clean Up Specific Frequency Ranges:
  - Target problematic frequencies with precise control
  - Use different slopes for high-pass and low-pass sections as needed
  - Perfect for removing both rumble and high-frequency noise simultaneously

### Parameters
- **HPF Frequency (Hz)** - Controls where low frequencies are filtered out (10Hz to 40000Hz; the effective upper limit also depends on the audio sample rate)
  - Lower values: Only the very lowest frequencies are removed
  - Higher values: More low frequencies are removed
  - Adjust based on the specific low-frequency content you want to eliminate
- **HPF Slope** - Controls how aggressively frequencies below the cutoff are reduced
  - Off: No filtering applied
  - -12dB/oct: Gentle filtering (LR2 - 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -24dB/oct: Standard filtering (LR4 - 4th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -36dB/oct: Stronger filtering (LR6 - 6th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -48dB/oct: Very strong filtering (LR8 - 8th order Linkwitz-Riley)
- **LPF Frequency (Hz)** - Controls where high frequencies are filtered out (10Hz to 40000Hz; the effective upper limit also depends on the audio sample rate)
  - Lower values: More high frequencies are removed
  - Higher values: Only the very highest frequencies are removed
  - Adjust based on the specific high-frequency content you want to eliminate
- **LPF Slope** - Controls how aggressively frequencies above the cutoff are reduced
  - Off: No filtering applied
  - -12dB/oct: Gentle filtering (LR2 - 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -24dB/oct: Standard filtering (LR4 - 4th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -36dB/oct: Stronger filtering (LR6 - 6th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -48dB/oct: Very strong filtering (LR8 - 8th order Linkwitz-Riley)
