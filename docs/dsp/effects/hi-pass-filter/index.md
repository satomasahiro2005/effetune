## Hi Pass Filter

A precision high-pass filter that removes unwanted low frequencies while preserving the clarity of higher frequencies. Based on Linkwitz-Riley filter design for optimal phase response and transparent sound quality.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Remove Unwanted Rumble:
  - Set frequency between 20-40Hz to eliminate subsonic noise
  - Use steeper slopes (-24dB/oct or higher) for cleaner bass
  - Ideal for vinyl recordings or live performances with stage vibrations
- Clean Up Bass-Heavy Music:
  - Set frequency between 60-100Hz to tighten bass response
  - Use moderate slopes (-12dB/oct to -24dB/oct) for natural transition
  - Helps prevent speaker overload and improves clarity
- Create Special Effects:
  - Set frequency between 200-500Hz for a thinner, low-cut voice effect
  - Use steep slopes (-48dB/oct or higher) for dramatic filtering
  - For a telephone-like voice effect, combine with Lo Pass Filter around 3-4kHz

### Parameters
- **Frequency (Hz)** - Controls where low frequencies are filtered out (10Hz to 40000Hz; the effective upper limit also depends on the audio sample rate)
  - Lower values: Only the very lowest frequencies are removed
  - Higher values: More low frequencies are removed
  - Adjust based on the specific low-frequency content you want to eliminate
- **Slope** - Controls how aggressively frequencies below the cutoff are reduced
  - Off: No filtering applied
  - -12dB/oct: Gentle filtering (LR2 - 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -24dB/oct: Standard filtering (LR4 - 4th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -36dB/oct: Stronger filtering (LR6 - 6th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -48dB/oct: Very strong filtering (LR8 - 8th order Linkwitz-Riley)
  - -60dB/oct to -96dB/oct: Extremely steep filtering for special applications
