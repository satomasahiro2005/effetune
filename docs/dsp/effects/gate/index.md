# Gate

Semantic type: `Gate` · Category: dynamics

Attenuates signals below a configurable threshold.

This type has catalog telemetry metadata but no public observation API. See [Compatibility](/dsp/reference/compatibility/#analyzers-and-telemetry).

## Contract

- Seeded: **no**
- Catalog sample rates: **not declared; this does not mean unsupported**
- Assets: **none**
- Catalog-declared latency: **zero**
- Telemetry: **catalog metadata only; no public observation API**

| Semantic name | Python constructor keyword | Type / count | Default | Unit | Range or values |

| `threshold` | `threshold` | number / 1 | `-40` | dB | -96 … 0 |
| `ratio` | `ratio` | number / 1 | `10` | Not declared in catalog | 1 … 100 |
| `attack` | `attack` | number / 1 | `1` | ms | 0.01 … 50 |
| `release` | `release` | number / 1 | `200` | ms | 10 … 2000 |

## Gate

A full-band noise gate that turns down the whole signal when the level falls below a specified threshold. It is useful for lowering low-level noise during gaps, fades, or between spoken phrases. It does not separate and remove fan noise, hum, or room noise while music or speech is playing over it.

### Key Features
- Precise threshold control for accurate noise detection
- Adjustable ratio for natural or aggressive noise reduction
- Variable attack and release times for optimal timing control
- Soft knee option for smooth transitions
- Real-time gain reduction metering
- Interactive transfer function display

### Parameters

- **Threshold** (-96dB to 0dB)
  - Sets the level where noise reduction begins
  - Signals below this level will be attenuated
  - Higher values: More aggressive noise reduction
  - Lower values: More subtle effect
  - Start at -40dB and adjust based on your noise floor

- **Ratio** (1:1 to 100:1)
  - Controls how strongly signals below threshold are attenuated
  - 1:1: No effect
  - 10:1: Strong noise reduction
  - 100:1: Near-complete silence below threshold
  - Start at 10:1 for typical noise reduction

- **Attack Time** (0.01ms to 50ms)
  - How quickly the gate responds when signal rises above threshold
  - Faster times: More precise but may sound abrupt
  - Slower times: More natural transitions
  - Try 1ms as a starting point

- **Release Time** (10ms to 2000ms)
  - How quickly the gate closes when signal falls below threshold
  - Faster times: Tighter noise control
  - Slower times: More natural decay
  - Start with 200ms for natural sound

- **Knee** (0dB to 6dB)
  - Controls how gradually the gate transitions around threshold
  - 0dB: Hard knee for precise gating
  - 6dB: Soft knee for smoother transitions
  - Use 1dB for general purpose noise reduction

- **Gain** (-12dB to +12dB)
  - Adjusts the output level after gating
  - Use to compensate for any perceived volume loss
  - Typically left at 0dB unless needed

### Recommended Settings

#### Light Noise Reduction
- Threshold: -50dB
- Ratio: 2:1
- Attack: 5ms
- Release: 300ms
- Knee: 3dB
- Gain: 0dB

#### Moderate Background Noise
- Threshold: -40dB
- Ratio: 10:1
- Attack: 1ms
- Release: 200ms
- Knee: 1dB
- Gain: 0dB

#### Very Aggressive Gating
- Use only when you want near-silence in gaps, such as spoken recordings or very noisy pauses
- Threshold: -30dB
- Ratio: 50:1
- Attack: 0.1ms
- Release: 100ms
- Knee: 0dB
- Gain: 0dB

### Application Tips
- Set threshold just above the noise floor for optimal results
- Use longer release times for more natural sound
- Add some knee when processing complex material
- Monitor the gain reduction meter to ensure proper gating
- For music, avoid very high thresholds or ratios unless you intentionally want to cut off quiet tails
- Combine with other dynamics processors for comprehensive control
