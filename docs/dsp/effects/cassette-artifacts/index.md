# Cassette Artifacts

Semantic type: `CassetteArtifacts` · Category: lo-fi

Models the record and reproduce chain of a compact-cassette deck, including Dolby B/C, saturation, wow and flutter, hiss, dropouts, and azimuth error.

This type can intentionally generate output from zero input at an active setting. See [Processing model](/dsp/concepts/processing-model/#source-generating-effects).

## Cassette Artifacts

Cassette Artifacts combines cassette frequency response, tape compression, hiss, wow and flutter, dropouts, and head-alignment changes. Use it for a complete cassette-deck character rather than a noise layer added over unchanged music.

### How It Differs from Other Lo-Fi Effects

- **Tape Artifacts** gives a cleaner, wider-band open-reel sound with selectable speed. Cassette Artifacts is darker and offers cassette-specific Deck Grade, Tape Type, noise reduction, dropouts, and head alignment.
- **Wow Flutter** (Modulation) reproduces only the speed variation of a transport. Choose it when you want the wobble without tape saturation, the Type and bias behavior, the noise reduction, or the hiss.
- **Saturation** and **Hard Clipping** add nonlinearity on its own, without the frequency-dependent behavior and the transport of a tape machine.
- **Vinyl Artifacts**, **Noise Blender** and **Hum Generator** add noise without changing the music's frequency response or dynamics.

### Sound Character Guide

- **Deck Grade** moves from the wide, steady Reference sound toward the darker and less stable Portable sound.
- Raise **Record Level** for stronger compression and saturation; lower it for cleaner dynamics. Use Output to match loudness afterward.
- **Tape Type** changes noise and headroom. Type I is the noisiest, Type II is balanced, and Type IV keeps bright peaks cleaner.
- **Noise Reduction** lowers hiss. Dolby C is stronger than Dolby B, while Off gives the rawest cassette background.
- Raise **Wow/Flutter**, **Hiss**, or **Dropouts** for a more worn sound. **Azimuth** darkens and shifts the high frequencies between channels.

### System Presets

Click **Effect Presets** in the effect header to switch between complete cassette-deck characters.

- **Flagship Deck Metal** - A quiet, steady reference deck using metal tape and Dolby C.
- **Hi-Fi Chrome** - A clean Type II cassette with restrained hiss and pitch movement.
- **Pocket Cassette Player** - A portable-player sound with noise, wobble, and head misalignment.
- **Worn Mixtape** - A heavily used tape with dropouts, wobble, and rougher saturation.
- **Hot Deck Saturation** - A deliberately hard-driven cassette sound with stronger tape compression.

### Parameters

Compact cassette speed is fixed, so there is no Speed control.

- **Deck Grade** (Reference, Hi-Fi, Consumer or Portable) - Chooses the deck character. Reference is widest and steadiest; Portable is darkest and least stable. Start with Consumer for a familiar home-deck sound.
- **Tape Type** (Type I, Type II or Type IV) - Changes tape noise and headroom. Type I is noisiest, Type II is balanced, and Type IV keeps bright peaks cleaner.
- **Noise Reduction** (Off, Dolby B or Dolby C) - Reduces hiss. Dolby B is moderate, Dolby C is stronger, and Off leaves the raw cassette background. Use Dolby Level Error if you want the brighter or duller sound of mismatched decks.
- **Bias** (-6.0 to +6.0 dB) - Changes treble and distortion. Start at 0 dB. Small positive values sound cleaner and darker; small negative values sound brighter and rougher. Extreme negative settings become distorted without continuing to brighten.
- **Record Level** (-12.0 to +18.0 dB) - Controls how hard the tape is driven. Start at +9 dB. Raise it for denser compression and saturation; lower it for cleaner dynamics. Match loudness afterward with Output.
- **Wow/Flutter** (0 to 1%) - Controls pitch instability. 0% is steady, the 0.200% default gives audible cassette movement on sustained notes, and higher values create a worn-deck warble.
- **Hiss** (-92.0 to -42.0 dB re 250 nWb/m) - Controls tape hiss and signal-related modulation noise. Raise it for a noisier tape or set it to the minimum to switch the noise layer off. The status line shows the resulting background level for the current settings.
- **Dropouts** (0 to 20 events/min) - Sets how often brief signal dips occur. 0 disables them, 2 events/min gives occasional wear, and higher values sound increasingly damaged.
- **Azimuth** (-6.0 to +6.0 arcmin) - Simulates head misalignment. Move away from 0 to soften treble and change the left/right timing; the sign selects which channel leads.
- **Dolby Level Error** (-3.0 to +3.0 dB) - Simulates a mismatch between recording and playback decks when Noise Reduction is on. Positive values sound brighter and hissier; negative values sound duller. Start at 0 dB.
- **Output** (-24.0 to +24.0 dB) - Adjusts the level after the whole chain. Use it to match loudness when you compare with bypass, or to bring back the loudness a high Record Level setting has cost.
- **Mix** (0 to 100%) - Blends the cassette sound with the original. Start at 100% to judge the full effect; lower it for a subtler result. Intermediate values can soften the highest frequencies because the two paths partly cancel there.
