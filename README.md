## Setup Guide

Before using EffeTune, you'll need to set up your audio routing. Here's how to configure different audio sources:

### Music File Player Setup

- Open the EffeTune web app in your browser, or launch the EffeTune desktop app
- Open and play a music file to ensure proper playback
   - Open a music file and select EffeTune as the application (desktop app only)
   - Or select Open music file... from the File menu (desktop app only)
   - Or drag the music file into the window
- For player-only use, set Input Device to None (music file player only) in Audio Configuration to avoid using a live audio input
- Open the playback speed button next to Shuffle to show its popup. Choose one of the nine presets, or use the horizontal slider or number field to set a speed from 0.25x to 4x in 0.01x steps. The **Preserve Pitch** button next to it is on by default, so pitch stays the same as speed changes; turn it off to let pitch rise and fall with speed, like changing the speed of a tape or record.
- In the desktop app, choose **View > Mini Player** (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+M) or use the player’s mini-player button to keep playback controls in a compact window. The pin button keeps it above other windows.

### Streaming Service Setup

To process audio from streaming services (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.):

1. Prerequisites:
   - Install a virtual audio device (e.g., VB Cable, Voice Meeter, or ASIO Link Tool)
   - Configure your streaming service to output audio to the virtual audio device

2. Configuration:
   - Open the EffeTune web app in your browser, or launch the EffeTune desktop app
   - Select the virtual audio device as the input source
     - In Chrome, the first time you open it, a dialog box appears asking you to select and allow audio input
     - Open Audio Configuration from the Settings menu to choose input/output devices and audio format
   - Start playing music from your streaming service
   - Verify that audio is flowing through EffeTune
   - For more detailed setup instructions, see the [FAQ](docs/faq.md)

### Physical Audio Source Setup

To use EffeTune with CD players, network players, or other physical sources:

- Connect your audio interface to your computer
- Open the EffeTune web app in your browser, or launch the EffeTune desktop app
- Select your audio interface as the input and output source
   - In Chrome, the first time you open it, a dialog box appears asking you to select and allow audio input
   - Open Audio Configuration from the Settings menu to choose input/output devices and audio format
- Your audio interface now functions as a multi-effects processor:
   * Input: Your CD player, network player, or other audio source
   * Processing: Real-time effects through EffeTune
   * Output: Processed audio to your amplifier or speakers

## Usage

### Application Settings

Open **Settings > Config...** to choose **Language**, set **Startup view:**, and configure **Effect Pipeline at startup:**. **Startup view:** can be **Effect Pipeline (Default)**, **Music Library**, or **Visualizer**. When you choose Music Library, use its list to select **Tracks**, **Albums**, **Artists**, **Genres**, **Subfolders**, **Folders**, or **Playlists** as the first library view. Use **Theme** to choose the app colors: Graphite (default), Paper, Midnight, Ember, or Mint.

Supported desktop builds can also be controlled by OpenHome apps on the same local network. This is off by default; see [OpenHome Remote Control](docs/music-library.md#openhome-remote-control-desktop-app) for setup, network access, compatibility, and limitations.

### Browsing Your Music Library

1. Open **Music Library** from the PC header, the mobile **Library** tab, or **View > Music Library** in the desktop app.
2. Select **Add Music Folder** to index a folder of music files. External CUE sheets can divide WAV or FLAC album files in the same folder into individual tracks.
3. Browse **Tracks**, **Albums**, **Artists**, **Genres**, **Subfolders**, **Folders**, **Recently Added**, or **Playlists**, and use **Search library** to search the catalog. **Subfolders** groups tracks by their containing path inside each indexed root, while **Folders** manages those roots.
4. Use **Play** to listen through the current effect pipeline, or use **Play Next**, **Add to Queue**, and **Add to Playlist** to manage playback.
5. Use **Rescan** after changing files, and **Reconnect** if a browser or folder permission is lost.
   - [More about Music Library](docs/music-library.md)

In both PC and mobile layouts, track searches and album, artist, genre, subfolder, and playlist details select all matching tracks by default when there are 300 tracks or fewer; results with 301 tracks or more are not selected automatically. On mobile, automatic selection changes only the selection state. Only long-pressing a track enters selection mode and shows checkboxes, **Select All**, and **Deselect All**; selecting or deselecting tracks does not enter or leave that mode, and the usual row actions remain available.

PC Chromium browsers can keep access to selected music folders between sessions. In Safari, Firefox, mobile browsers, and other browsers without persistent folder access, select the folder or files again after each reload; EffeTune reconnects them to the existing catalog.

Large collections load in stages from storage; scanning and loading speed depends on your device, collection, and available memory. Very fast scrolling can briefly show blank rows while the next tracks load, especially on slow storage.

### Building Your Effect Chain

1. Available effects are listed on the left side of the screen
   - Use the search button next to "Available Effects" to filter effects
   - Type any text to find effects by name or category
   - Press ESC to clear the search
2. Drag effects from the list to the Effect Pipeline area
   - On mobile, open the Effects tab and tap the + button to add effects from the full-screen list
3. Effects are processed in order from top to bottom
4. Drag the handle (⋮) or click the ▲▼ buttons to reorder the effects
   - For Section effects: Shift+click the ▲▼ buttons to move entire sections (from one Section to the next Section, pipeline beginning, or end of pipeline)
5. Click an effect's name to expand/collapse its settings
   - Shift+click on a Section effect to collapse/expand all effects within that section
   - Shift+click on other effects to collapse/expand all effects except for the Analyzer category
   - Ctrl+click to collapse/expand all effects
6. Use the ON button to bypass individual effects
7. Click the ? button to open its detailed documentation in a new tab
8. Remove effects using the × button
   - For Section effects: Shift+click the × button to remove entire sections
9. Click the routing button to set the channels to be processed and the input and output busses
   - [More about bus functions](docs/bus-function.md)
   - [Control effect parameters with MIDI, gamepads, or the keyboard](docs/controller-mapping.md)
10. Click an effect's Effect Presets button to save or apply settings for that effect only
11. For fine slider adjustment, hold Shift while dragging; the value changes by one minimum step at a time
   - For sliders with both negative and positive values, the fill extends from 0 to the current value. Ratio sliders use 1.0 as their starting point.
12. On supported frequency and note graphs, drag along the graph's axis to preview that frequency as a -12 dB sine tone through the effect chain. Piano-key displays snap to the nearest semitone; dragging over a key previews that key's pitch

### Using Presets

Click the **Pipeline Presets** button in the Effect Pipeline header to open the preset dialog.

1. Load a preset by selecting it from the saved preset list. This restores the complete effect chain, including effect order, settings, and ON/OFF states.
2. Save the current effect chain by entering a name and selecting **Save**.
3. Rename a saved preset with its rename button.
4. Select one or more saved presets, then choose **Delete Selected** and confirm to remove them.
5. Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on macOS) to open the dialog with the current preset name ready to edit.

Each effect also has its own **Effect Presets** button. It opens system presets when the effect provides them and lets you save, rename, load, or remove your own settings for that effect. Effect presets change only that effect's parameters; they do not change its ON/OFF state or routing.

The existing `.effetune_preset` file import, export, and sharing features continue to use complete effect-chain presets.

### Backing Up and Restoring Saved Data

Open **Settings > Backup / Restore** to move saved pipeline presets, effect presets, impulse responses, and measurements between the web app, desktop app, and browser extension. Named Visualizer presets can also be backed up in the web and desktop apps; the current working layout is not included. Select individual items or whole categories. A preset automatically selects data that it needs; clearing required data also clears presets that depend on it.

**Include measurement data** and **Include impulse response data** are on by default, making the backup self-contained. Turning either option off stores references for that type. Those references can be restored only when matching data already exists at the destination. Restored impulse responses go into EffeTune's managed **Impulse Response Library**. Existing identical data is reused, while a different item with the same name is added under a numbered name. The current pipeline, volume, selected preset, device settings, and extension URL rules are not changed.

Each `.effetune_backup` file is limited to 256 MB; create separate backups when your selection is larger. If restoration stops, completed items remain available and you can safely restore the same file again. Before sharing a backup, review the selection: it can contain preset names and comments, original impulse-response files, and measurement details. Music files, Music Library data, application preferences, device choices, URL rules, credentials, and an unsaved current pipeline are not included. A preset can be carried to the browser extension even when its routing or effects cannot be applied there; it remains saved and can be backed up again.

### Using Section Features

1. Section Effect Usage:
   - Add a Section effect at the beginning of a group of effects
   - Enter a descriptive name in the Comment field
   - Toggling the Section ON/OFF bypasses or restores that section while preserving each effect's own ON/OFF state
   - Use multiple Section effects to organize your effect chain into logical groups
   - [More about control effects](docs/plugins/control.md)

### Using AB Pipeline Features

1. AB Pipeline Overview:
   - EffeTune can maintain two separate effect pipelines: Pipeline A and Pipeline B
   - At startup, only Pipeline A is loaded; Pipeline B is created when needed
   - All processing, saving, loading, and editing operations work on the currently selected pipeline

2. AB Toggle Button:
   - Located to the right of the Effect Pipeline header
   - Shows "A" by default (Pipeline A active)
   - Click to switch between Pipeline A and Pipeline B
   - If Pipeline B doesn't exist when toggling, Pipeline A's settings are copied to Pipeline B

3. AB Menu (Dropdown Button):
   - Located to the right of the AB toggle button
   - "A → B": Copy Pipeline A settings to Pipeline B and switch to Pipeline B
   - "B → A": Copy Pipeline B settings to Pipeline A and switch to Pipeline A

4. Double Blind Test:
   - Compare Pipeline A and Pipeline B by ear without knowing which one is playing
   - Run an ABX test to check whether you can really tell the two pipelines apart, or an A/B preference test to find out which one you prefer, with a statistical significance check
   - Open it from the ▼ pipeline menu to the right of the AB toggle button (also available from the File menu in the desktop app)
   - [More about the Double Blind Test](docs/double-blind-test.md)

   - Ctrl + M: Toggle Repeat mode
   - Ctrl + H: Toggle Shuffle mode
   - T: Toggle Pipeline A/B
   - A: Switch to Pipeline A
   - B: Switch to Pipeline B

### Processing Audio Files

1. File Drop or File Specification Area:
   - A dedicated drop area is always visible below the Effect Pipeline
   - Supports single or multiple audio files
   - Files are processed using the current Pipeline settings
   - Effects are processed at the Pipeline's sample rate; any output sample-rate conversion happens afterward

2. Processing Status:
   - Progress bar shows current processing status
   - Processing time depends on file size and effect chain complexity

3. Download or Save Options:
   - In **Settings > Config > Offline file output**, choose WAV or FLAC, plus its sample rate and quality. For FLAC, choose 16-bit or 24-bit lossless encoding. The default is WAV at 96 kHz with 24-bit PCM
   - Formats have different channel limits. EffeTune stops with guidance instead of automatically downmixing a file that exceeds the selected format's limit
   - For multiple files, select an output folder before processing begins; each file is saved directly to that folder as it completes
   - On older browsers without folder selection support, multiple files are packaged into a ZIP file for download

### Sharing Effect Chains

You can share your effect chain configuration with other users:
1. After setting up your desired effect chain, click the "Share" button in the top-right corner of the Effect Pipeline area
2. The web app URL will be automatically copied to your clipboard
3. Share the copied URL with others - they can recreate your exact effect chain by opening it
4. Shared URLs store the effect settings needed for reproduction; the web app also restores your normal working state from browser storage
5. In the desktop app version, export the settings to an effetune_preset file from the File menu
6. Share the exported effetune_preset file. The effetune_preset file can also be loaded by dragging it into the web app window

### Audio Reset

If you experience audio issues (dropouts, glitches):
1. Choose "Reset Audio" from the Settings menu or mobile overflow menu. In the desktop app, you can also select Reload from the View menu
2. The audio pipeline will be rebuilt automatically
3. Your effect chain configuration will be preserved

### Frequency Response Measurement and Correction

To measure your audio system's frequency response and create a flat correction EQ:
1. Launch the [Frequency Response Measurement tool](https://effetune.frieve.com/features/measurement/measurement.html), or select Frequency Response Measurement from the Settings menu.
2. Follow the guided setup to configure your measurement microphone and output device
3. Measure your system's frequency response at one or more listening positions
4. Generate a parametric EQ correction that can be directly imported into EffeTune
5. Apply the correction to achieve a more accurate, neutral sound reproduction

Set **Output Device Channels** to match your output device: **6** for 5.1 or **8** for 7.1. Output channel and per-channel bandwidth choices stay within this range. Test signals, measurements, and individual channel remeasurement use this count even when only some channels are selected. For example, keep **6** when measuring only Ch 3 (center) and Ch 4 (subwoofer) on a 5.1 device.

For a multichannel system, select **All Channels** to measure all outputs together, or select individual **Output Channel** entries to measure them one at a time. Under **Advanced Settings**, choose **Off**, **Same for All Channels**, or **Per Channel** for sweep bandwidth. With **Per Channel**, use **Channel to Configure** to set each selected output channel's frequency range. During level adjustment, **Channel Mode** starts at **Automatic Rotation**; select a test-signal channel or **Manual** when needed.

If you already have an impulse-response WAV file, choose **Import** and select it. EffeTune saves each WAV channel as a measurement result, so you can select it in Room EQ and anywhere else that uses saved measurements.

To remove the audio interface's own response, connect its output directly to its input and save that loopback as a normal, uncalibrated measurement with an impulse response. For the next measurement, choose that saved point under **Audio Interface Calibration**. Use the same interface, input and output channels, sampling rate, and input/output gains, and do not change the gains after the loopback measurement. Choose **None (uncalibrated)** to measure without this correction.

Saved measurements with impulse-response data show a normalized **Impulse Response** plot in the results. It opens at 0–10 ms from the detected onset. Use the mouse wheel or buttons to zoom the time axis, and drag the plot or use the slider to scroll. Selecting a measurement point updates the plot; **All (Average)** displays the first point that has saved impulse-response data and identifies it above the graph. Use **Export Impulse Response (WAV)** below the plot to save the displayed point's complete, unnormalized response as a mono 32-bit floating-point WAV at the measurement sample rate.

To inspect the active pipeline's Frequency, Phase, Min Group Delay, Excess Group Delay, and Impulse responses—including up to four selected outputs and optional saved speaker responses—see the [Pipeline Analyzer guide](docs/pipeline-analyzer.md).

### Visualizer

Open **Visualizer** from the PC header, the mobile **Player** tab, or the desktop **View** menu. Choose a built-in layout or select **Edit** to arrange audio graphs, artwork, and track information. Changes take effect immediately and return at the next launch; use the preset dialog to save a named copy. Hover over or tap the display and select **⛶** to fill the app window. See the [Visualizer guide](docs/visualizer.md) for editing, effects, and display options.

### Gapless Playback

**Gapless Playback** is on by default and can be changed in **Audio Configuration**. When it is on, compatible local tracks play without a gap; support is limited by the file format and the current browser or app environment. Unsupported formats and some mobile environments automatically use a memory-safe fallback, so a short gap may still occur. Turning it off prioritizes lower memory use and stability, and may add a short gap between tracks. Changing the setting does not interrupt the current track. Gapless playback is unavailable while playback speed is not 1x; changing speed during a track that was playing gaplessly restarts it from the same position with a brief interruption.

## Technical Information

### Browser Compatibility

Frieve EffeTune has been tested and verified to work on Google Chrome. The application requires a modern browser with support for:
- Web Audio API
- Audio Worklet
- getUserMedia API
- Drag and Drop API
- Service Worker, for installable/offline web app support

### Browser Support Details
1. Chrome/Chromium
   - Fully supported and recommended
   - Update to latest version for best performance

2. Firefox/Safari
   - Limited support
   - Some features such as output device selection, Wake Lock, install behavior, or audio file formats may vary by browser
   - Consider using Chrome for best experience

### Recommended Sample Rate

Set EffeTune's **Sample Rate** to 96 kHz. This reduces audible-band aliasing from nonlinear effects whose anti-aliasing is limited. The setting controls EffeTune's processing rate and can normally differ from the OS, audio-device, and VB-CABLE rates, so those do not need to be changed. Confirm the effective Sample Rate shown in the app: the initial unsaved setting may follow the OS or browser default, and the Web version may fall back if 96 kHz is unavailable. If playback drops out, first disable demanding effects or shorten the chain; lower the sample rate only if needed.

## DSP Library

EffeTune's DSP engine is also an independent, deterministic MIT-licensed
library for Python, JavaScript, and browser AudioWorklets. Its public Chain
schema and generated effect catalog can be used without the EffeTune app.
See the [EffeTune DSP Library documentation](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/).

<!-- BEGIN DSP-LIBRARY-BRIDGE -->
Use the package quickstarts for installation and complete runnable examples:
