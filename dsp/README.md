# EffeTune DSP Library and Core

The DSP core is published as the **EffeTune DSP Library** for Python,
JavaScript, and browser AudioWorklets. Start with the
[DSP Library documentation](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/) for the complete
guides, effect catalog, API reference, live demo, and details about streaming,
assets, and deterministic processing.

The library can process audio independently of the EffeTune app. Python and
JavaScript use the same C++20 DSP core and the same semantic Chain JSON format,
so a chain can be shared between the two packages. The app can optionally be
used as a visual preset editor.

Choose the section that matches your goal:

- **Use the library:** [Python quick start](#python-quick-start),
  [JavaScript quick start](#javascript-quick-start), and
  [Chains and Effects](#chains-and-effects)
- **Develop the C++ core:** [DSP Core Development](#dsp-core-development),
  including the [verification workflow](#verification-workflow),
  [ABI and memory rules](#abi-and-real-time-memory), and
  [kernel capacity decisions](#kernel-capacity-decisions)

## Python Quick Start

Install the package from PyPI:

```console
pip install effetune
```

Pass a C-contiguous `float32` NumPy array with shape `(channels, frames)` to a
chain. The library does not resample audio.

```python
import numpy as np
import effetune as et

frames = 512
phase = np.arange(frames, dtype=np.float32)
mono = (0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * phase / 97)).astype(np.float32)
audio = np.ascontiguousarray(np.stack((mono, mono)))

chain = et.Chain([et.Volume(volume=-6)])
output = chain.process(audio, sample_rate=48_000)
print(output.shape)
```

Generated effect constructors use Python `snake_case` parameter names. Use
`Chain.stream()` instead of `Chain.process()` when filter history, delay or
reverb tails, or seeded random state must continue across blocks. See the
[Python guide](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/getting-started/python/) for
audio-file processing and the full API.

## JavaScript Quick Start

Install the ESM-only package from npm:

```console
npm install @effetune/dsp
```

Pass one equal-length `Float32Array` per channel. The package does not decode,
encode, or resample audio.

```js
import { createChain } from '@effetune/dsp';

const frames = 512;
const mono = Float32Array.from(
  { length: frames },
  (_, frame) => 0.5 * Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * frame / 97)
);
const input = [mono.slice(), mono.slice()];

const chain = await createChain({
  version: 1,
  chain: [{
    id: 'volume',
    type: 'Volume',
    parameters: { volume: -6 }
  }]
});
const output = await chain.process(input, { sampleRate: 48000 });
console.log(output.length, output[0].length);
chain.close();
```

Node.js 18 or newer is required. In a browser, use a bundler or import map and
serve the package's JavaScript, WebAssembly, and metadata assets from the same
secure origin. For real-time browser audio, use the package-owned AudioWorklet.
See the [JavaScript guide](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/getting-started/javascript/)
and [AudioWorklet guide](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/getting-started/audioworklet/)
for complete setup.

## Chains and Effects

A Chain is an ordered serial effect pipeline. Each effect has a semantic type,
an ID, and parameters; the same Chain JSON is accepted by both language
bindings. The generated
[effect reference](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/effects/) lists every
available effect and its parameter names, defaults, ranges, channel behavior,
latency, and asset requirements. Offline processing starts with fresh DSP
state, while streaming preserves state across blocks.

For file and batch processing without writing an application, see the
[CLI guide](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/getting-started/cli/).

### Graph v1

Graph v1 is an experimental, opt-in API for static directed acyclic processing
graphs. It keeps the same Effect objects as Chain v1 while adding fan-out,
deterministic additive fan-in, edge gain/mute/stereo-pan/solo controls, wet/dry
and send/return routing, and automatic delay compensation. Chain remains the
default for serial processing, and existing Chain documents and behavior are
unchanged.

A Graph is fully validated, prepared, and allocated before its immutable plan
is installed. The audio callback does not validate or traverse the document,
allocate memory, activate assets, or change the graph structure. See the
[Graph v1 guide](https://effetune.frieve.com/dsp/reference/graph-v1/) for the
document, JavaScript and Python APIs, recipes, snapshots, errors, and deliberate
first-version limitations.

The generated Graph contract is the capacity authority for the schema, core,
bindings, and public guide. Delay-compensation storage shares its published
workspace limit rather than a separate delay quota.

## DSP Core Development

This directory contains the host-neutral C++20 DSP core. It has no browser or
WebAudio API dependencies. The build produces:

- A native static library used by tests
- A baseline standalone WebAssembly module
- A SIMD128 standalone WebAssembly module

The WebAssembly modules are used by the web, PWA, and Electron hosts.

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.24 or newer
- Ninja
- Python 3.10 or newer (standard library only, for binary model embedding)
- A C++20 compiler for native tests
- Emscripten SDK 6.0.2 for WebAssembly builds

On Windows, install and activate the version recorded in `EMSDK_VERSION`, then
set `EMSDK` to the activated SDK root. The build script checks `emcc --version`
and rejects other SDK versions.

### Verification Workflow

Run these commands in order:

```text
npm run gen:dsp
npm run test:dsp:warnings
npm run test:dsp
node tools/dsp-parity/run.mjs --native
npm run build:dsp
node tools/dsp-parity/run.mjs --wasm
node tools/dsp-parity/run.mjs --wasm --simd
```

The commands perform these checks:

1. `npm run gen:dsp` validates every `dsp/plugins/**/params.json` and
   deterministically updates the C++ headers and runtime JavaScript packers in
   `js/audio/dsp-params.generated.js`. Add `-- --check` to verify freshness
   without writing.
2. `npm run test:dsp:warnings` uses the pinned Emscripten Clang frontend to
   compile every registered native test source with warnings as errors,
   including `-Wunused-but-set-variable`. It does not link or run the tests.
3. `npm run test:dsp` configures a native build and runs CTest.
4. `node tools/dsp-parity/run.mjs --native` runs every golden through the native
   runner.
5. `npm run build:dsp` repeats the warning check, builds the baseline and
   SIMD128 modules, copies them to `plugins/dsp/`, smoke-instantiates both
   artifacts, and writes deterministic metadata.
6. The final two parity commands verify baseline WASM and baseline-plus-SIMD
   processing.

The native test and parity steps do not require emsdk; the warning check does.
Build directories are created below the repository-root `out/dsp/` directory.

### ABI and Real-Time Memory

#### Native pipeline latency updates

Native hosts using `core/engine.h` can update compensation for an existing
pipeline without rebuilding its topology or stopping processing. The C ABI and
language bindings are unchanged. The Engine remains owned by one thread; these
methods do not provide a mailbox or make other Engine operations thread-safe.

1. On the Engine's owning audio thread, between blocks, stage parameters using
   the existing instance API and call `capturePipelineLatencySnapshot(snapshot)`.
   The fixed-size snapshot records the configured topology and the kernels'
   latest reported latencies. Transfer its value to a control thread using the
   host's synchronized handoff.
2. Off the audio thread, call the static
   `Engine::preparePipelineLatencyUpdate(snapshot, update)`. It reads only the
   snapshot, calculates the plan and allocates compensation storage. It never
   reads or modifies the live Engine. `update.plannedLatency()` is a proposed
   value, not the applied latency.
3. Transfer exclusive access to the prepared update to the audio thread. After
   staging that block's parameters and before `processPipeline`, call
   `applyPipelineLatencyUpdate(update)`. It verifies the Engine, configuration
   revision and latest kernel latencies, then installs the compensation without
   allocation, deallocation, locks or I/O. On success, read `pipelineLatency()`
   on that thread and publish that applied value to the host.
4. Transfer the update back to the control thread before reusing or destroying
   it. After a successful application it can own retired buffers. Snapshots and
   updates must not outlive their originating Engine. Never prepare, destroy or
   access an update concurrently with its application.

`ET_ERR_STATE` from capture means no pipeline is configured. Preparation returns
`ET_ERR_OOM` when storage cannot be allocated; any failure makes that update
unusable. Application returns `ET_ERR_STATE` for an unprepared, consumed, wrong
Engine or stale update. All these failures leave the active compensation and
its reported latency unchanged. Discard stale results on the control thread,
capture the latest state and prepare again. A successful application consumes
its update and invalidates other results captured against the previous plan.

Parameter staging and compensation preparation are separate. Kernels can report
staged latency before their next processing call; latency changes also may arise
from asset activation during processing. While preparation is outstanding,
processing continues using the existing compensation. `pipelineLatency()` still
reports that applied plan, not a promise that newly changed kernels already
align with it. The host must request another snapshot when a kernel changes,
apply a matching result at a block boundary, and update its bypass delay and
host notification only after that application succeeds. This API does not
provide an atomic transaction covering parameter changes, host bypass and host
notifications, or guarantee click-free retiming.

Each processor receives its selected channels aligned to their longest input
latency, whether it processes a stereo pair or all channels. Its selected outputs
then share that latency plus the processor's own latency. This keeps channel
splits and mixes aligned on every bus. A cross-bus send aligns its working copy
without changing the source bus; additive bus merges and final output alignment
apply the remaining delays.

Unchanged delays retain their history. Shorter delays reuse existing storage;
longer delays copy all retained recent samples into prepared storage before
swapping it in. History older than the previous capacity starts at zero. A
merge changing which signal it delays clears only that channel's compensation
history, since the old signal is not valid history for the new one. Output
alignment retains history on channels even when their current delay is zero,
once output delay storage exists. No effect state is reset and no processing
block is replaced by silence or dry audio. The existing channel, bus, block-size,
master-bypass and explicit reset contracts remain in effect.

#### ABI Contract

The C ABI in `include/effetune/abi.h` is the host ABI for the bundled
WebAssembly modules. ABI version 1 is not a supported public native ABI or a
native binary-compatibility promise. See the
[Phase 0 native ABI audit](../experiments/dsp-library-phase0/native-abi-audit.md).

The main ABI rules are:

- Exported signatures use only 32-bit handles and offsets; they contain no
  `i64` values.
- Each engine is independent and owns all of its DSP state.
- `et_engine_memory_required` validates and preflights the engine arena.
- Memory may grow only during `et_engine_prepare` or kernel setup from
  `et_instance_create`.
- Hosts must refresh arena views after either lifecycle call and before the
  next audio quantum.
- Audio processing never allocates or grows memory.

#### Engine Arena

The arena contains:

- The combined buffer (bus 0) and buses 1-4
- Four full-size scratch slabs: `allChannels`, `mixing`, `stereo`, and `mono`
- A 4 KiB byte scratch slab
- The telemetry ring and an equally sized telemetry staging slab

Neither engine processing nor a pipeline descriptor call allocates memory.

#### Deterministic Seeds

Random kernels receive deterministic 64-bit seeds through
`et_instance_set_seed(seedLow, seedHigh)`. Splitting the seed keeps `i64` out of
exported signatures. Parity hosts set each golden case seed explicitly; normal
instance creation uses a deterministic, instance-derived default.

### Kernel Capacity Decisions

The following kernels preallocate their maximum supported working storage.
This keeps `process` allocation-free while preserving the documented parameter
range.

#### Pitch Shifter

**Allocation model**

During `prepare`, Pitch Shifter allocates the maximum legal 500 ms window for
the prepared sample rate, maximum channel count, and maximum frame count. Each
channel receives:

- One input window
- One windowed-frame scratch area
- One output ring with space for three windows

All three use Float32 storage. A separate Float32 final-output scratch area is
sized as `maxChannels * maxFrames`.

**Maximum supported shape**

At 192 kHz and sixteen channels, the per-channel allocations contain 7,680,000
floats, or 30,720,000 bytes (30.72 MB, about 29.30 MiB). Including the small
final block and index arrays, one maximal instance is budgeted at roughly
30.8 MiB of kernel heap.

Kernel heap is additional to the engine arena and shares the WebAssembly
module's 256 MiB limit. The combined allocation of all effect instances must
remain within that limit.

**Why this capacity is retained**

A smaller fixed allocation would either reject the documented combination of
a 500 ms window, 192 kHz audio, and sixteen channels, or require an incompatible
allocation during processing. Shape changes therefore clear only the active
logical regions. Pitch and fine-tune changes retain the existing state.

#### Modal Resonator

**Allocation model**

The JavaScript implementation creates a two-second Float32 ring for every
resonator and channel. The public frequency range starts at log-frequency 3.0,
where `exp(3) = 20.0855 Hz`, so the longest legal integer delay is:

```text
floor(sampleRate / exp(3))
```

The native kernel allocates that delay plus one ring slot. This is observably
equivalent to the two-second ring because every read is relative to the write
position, and samples older than the longest legal delay cannot be read—even
after a live frequency change. Disabled resonators freeze both their position
and storage.

**Maximum supported shape**

At 192 kHz and sixteen channels:

- Ring length: 9,560 samples
- Five-resonator storage: 3,059,200 bytes (about 2.92 MiB)
- Literal two-second-ring storage avoided: 122,880,000 bytes

This keeps one maximal instance comfortably within the module's 256 MiB limit.
The ring is allocated only during `prepare`; processing does not allocate.

A defensive clamp maps an out-of-schema delay to the largest allocated delay,
preventing malformed raw parameter blocks from indexing outside the ring.

#### Noise Reduction

Noise Reduction reserves approximately 6 MiB of working storage at 192 kHz and
sixteen channels. This allocation is made during `prepare`; processing does not
allocate memory.

#### Spatial Mapper

Spatial Mapper reserves approximately 5.1 MiB at 192 kHz, sixteen channels and
48 analysis bands. The four channel timelines use 2.5 MiB, input and routed
spectra use 2 MiB, and FFT scratch, band tables, covariance state and the stage
schedule account for the remainder. Allocation occurs during `prepare`;
processing and parameter changes do not allocate. The 8192-sample transform
uses a 2048-sample hop and reports 10240 samples of latency at this rate.

The incremental PFFFT transforms and spatial operations share a 16-sample
stage schedule. Scalar FFT steps receive a higher cost weight than SIMD steps
based on their measured execution time; routing skips exact zero coefficients.

#### RS Reverb

**Allocation model**

RS Reverb preallocates every legal room-size delay during `prepare`. Each of
its eight comb lines receives a separate capacity derived from that line's base
delay:

```text
capacity[i] = ceil(sampleRate * baseDelay[i] * 1.03 * 5 * 0.001)
```

The public maximum room size is 50 m. The 1.03 factor covers the largest
positive delay jitter, and the room-size scale can multiply that delay by five.
Channels share one line-capacity table and use fixed offsets into a single
Float32 buffer.

Room-size changes select active lengths within the existing capacities. They
do not reallocate memory, and neither does audio processing.

**Maximum supported shape**

At 192 kHz and sixteen channels:

| Storage | Float32 samples | Bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Comb buffers | 4,271,680 | 17,086,720 |
| Complete instance | 4,456,016 | 17,824,064 |

The complete instance includes the comb buffers, a pre-delay ring with
`ceil(sampleRate * .05) + 1` samples, and two 5 ms all-pass buffers per
channel. Its total is about 17.00 MiB. Giving every comb line a uniform stride
based on the longest line would waste more than 3 MiB at this shape.

**State behavior**

- Sample-rate preparation recalculates line lengths.
- Fixed delay-jitter table values are retained; this kernel has no random
  generator or seed.
- An explicit reset clears delay-line history and restores the fixed initial
  state.

### Structured Parameters

ABI version 1 supports bounded structured parameter blocks without changing
the numeric float layout.

- `et_kernel_param_bytes_capacity` returns zero for numeric-only kernels and
  the maximum accepted byte count for other kernels.
- Hosts call `et_instance_set_param_bytes` after `et_instance_set_params` to
  stage a structured block.
- Both calls use the same generated layout hash and become visible at the next
  process boundary.

Matrix routing uses the `matrix-routes-v1` codec: a four-byte
version/reserved/route-count header followed by ordered three-byte
input/output/phase records. The 1,024-route limit fits the 4 KiB scratch slab
and preserves duplicate route order.

### Telemetry

Telemetry is emitted at 60 Hz by default.
`et_engine_set_telemetry_rate` changes the engine-wide rate; a value of zero
disables emission. `et_telemetry_staging_ptr` and `et_telemetry_capacity`
expose the prepared staging slab read through `et_telemetry_read`.

All payloads are little-endian and four-byte aligned. Consumers must accept the
exact payload size for the selected format version. The default format version
is 1; `TAP_SCOPE_SNAPSHOT` (type 3), `TAP_STEREO_FIELD` (type 6), and
`TAP_AM_RADIO_SIMULATOR` (type 17) use version 2. `TAP_NOTE_SPECTROGRAM`
(type 24) uses version 3. `TAP_SPECTRUM` (type 4) and `TAP_SPECTROGRAM`
(type 5) use version 2 for HQ output; Chroma Spiral always uses type 4 version 2.

#### Frame Types

- **Types 1-6 — analyzer frames.** Type 2, `TAP_GAIN_REDUCTION`, contains one
  nonnegative float32 dB value and is shared by Compressor, Gate, Expander, and
  BrickwallLimiter.
- **Types 4 and 5 — `TAP_SPECTRUM` and `TAP_SPECTROGRAM`.** Format version 2
  is emitted for the HQ spectrum and spectrogram paths, including Chroma Spiral's
  type 4 spectrum. It has a 48-byte header with sample rate,
  FFT-size exponent, nominal hop, analysis generation, capture-end sample index,
  frame index, log-grid count and bounds, and the first valid grid index and count.
  Type 4 then carries current and peak-held float32 dBFS values for every grid cell;
  type 5 carries 256 high-to-low log-frequency uint8 display intensities. Public
  JavaScript and Python decoders expose these as `SpectrumHqTelemetryFrame` with
  `kind` `spectrumHq` and `SpectrogramHqTelemetryFrame` with `kind`
  `spectrogramHq`. Version 1 remains the non-HQ frame format.
- **Type 7 — `TAP_LOUDNESS_LEVELS`.** Two float32 LUFS values.
- **Type 8 — `TAP_TRANSIENT_GAIN`.** One signed float32 dB value.
- **Type 9 — `TAP_CHANNEL_COUNT`.** One little-endian `u32` in the range 1-16.
- **Type 10 — `TAP_MULTI_CHANNEL_LEVELS`.** A `u8` channel count, three zero
  bytes, then one eight-byte record per channel. Each record contains a
  nonnegative float32 raw window peak, a zero-or-one effective-mute byte, and
  three zero bytes. Payload size is `4 + 8 * channelCount` bytes.
- **Type 14 — `TAP_FIVE_BAND_DYNAMIC_EQ`.** Exactly 24 bytes: a five-band
  count, three zero reserved bytes, and five signed float32 gain values in band
  order.
- **Type 15 — `TAP_VINYL_SIMULATOR`.** Exactly 48 bytes: eight float32 values
  followed by four cumulative little-endian `u32` counters. The float values
  describe left/right contact force in N, left/right mean pressure in Pa,
  tip-velocity RMS in m/s, left/right tracking signal-to-error ratio in dB, and
  contact-centroid jitter in ns. The counters track mistracks, skips, static
  pops, and dust hits.
- **Type 16 — `TAP_FM_RADIO_SIMULATOR`.** Exactly 216 bytes: five float32
  values, one cumulative little-endian `u32` counter, and forty-eight float32
  spectrum magnitudes. The first values report RF input level in dBuV,
  estimated CNR in dB, pilot-lock quality from 0-1, stereo blend from 0-1, and
  multipath echo depth in dB. The counter tracks FM threshold clicks. The
  spectrum uses dBFS on a fixed logarithmic grid from 300 Hz to 60 kHz.
- **Type 17 — `TAP_AM_RADIO_SIMULATOR`.** Format version 2 is exactly 28 bytes.
  Five float32 values at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 report carrier level before
  AGC in dB, AGC gain in dB, modulation depth in percent, fading level in dB,
  and stereo blend. Cumulative `u32` counters at offsets 20 and 24 track static
  and clipping events. Legacy version 1 is 24 bytes, omits stereo blend, and
  stores the counters at offsets 16 and 20; the parser accepts it for backward
  compatibility.
- **Type 18 — `TAP_SW_RADIO_SIMULATOR`.** Format version 1 is exactly 24 bytes.
  Four float32 values at offsets 0, 4, 8, and 12 report carrier level before AGC
  in dB, AGC gain in dB, modulation depth in percent, and fading level in dB.
  Cumulative `u32` counters at offsets 16 and 20 track static and clipping
  events. Shortwave reception is mono, so there is no stereo-blend field.

  The layout is the same in every reception mode, but several values are
  mode-dependent:

  - In AM, the pre-AGC IF level includes the carrier. In suppressed-carrier USB
    and LSB, it depends on the programme.
  - In USB and LSB, fading reports the virtual path gain at the suppressed
    carrier, not the attenuation or programme level of the sideband as a whole.
  - In USB and LSB, modulation depth represents transmitter sideband drive.
  - The clipping counter records only AM over-modulation and envelope-detector
    clipping, so it never advances in USB or LSB.

- **Type 19 — `TAP_TUBE_SIMULATOR`.** Format version 1 is exactly 72 bytes:
  eighteen little-endian float32 values, first for the left channel and then
  for the right. Each channel contains stage 1 cathode voltage, stage 2 cathode
  voltage, B+ voltage, stage 1 grid-to-cathode voltage, stage 1 plate-to-cathode
  voltage, stage 1 plate current, stage 2 grid-to-cathode voltage, stage 2
  plate-to-cathode voltage, and stage 2 plate current, in that order.
- **Type 20 — `TAP_PHASE_SELECT_MAP`.** Format version 1 is a 16-byte header
  followed by `pointCount` 12-byte records, for an exact payload size of
  `16 + 12 * pointCount` bytes. The header contains sample rate as float32,
  `pointCount` as `u16` (maximum 512), flags as `u16`, FFT size as `u32`, and
  frame maximum level in dB as float32. Each record contains float32 frequency
  in Hz, signed L/R phase difference in degrees (-180 to +180), and level in dB
  relative to the frame maximum.
- **Type 24 — `TAP_NOTE_SPECTROGRAM`.** Format version 3 is exactly 3,548 bytes:
  a 28-byte header followed by 440 float32 pitch-confidence levels in [0, 1]
  and 440 float32 volume levels in dB. The volume values include a 3 dB/octave
  correction above 100 Hz and use -240 dB for pitches without a measured level.
  The header contains float32 sample rate, observation time, and hop duration;
  `u16` pitch count 440 and first MIDI note 21; and `u32` frame index,
  divisions per semitone 5, and non-zero analysis generation. Public JavaScript
  and Python decoders expose this as `NoteSpectrogramTelemetryFrame` with
  `kind` `noteSpectrogram`; `levels` and `volumeDb` / `volume_db` are owned
  `Float32Array` or tuple values. Index `i` maps to MIDI
  `firstMidi + (i - 2) / divisionsPerSemitone`, placing five bins at -40, -20,
  0, +20, and +40 cents around each piano-key center.

- **Type 25 — `TAP_TV_AUDIO_SIMULATOR`.** Format version 1 is exactly 216 bytes:
  five float32 values, one cumulative little-endian `u32` error counter, and
  forty-eight float32 spectrum magnitudes. The float values report received
  carrier level in dBuV, estimated CNR in dB, scheme health from 0-1, selected
  path blend from 0-1, and multipath depth in dB. The spectrum uses dBFS on a
  fixed logarithmic grid. It represents recovered multiplex audio for analogue
  FM, detected audio for L AM, and selected output audio for NICAM.

- **Type 26 — `TAP_PITCH_METER`.** Format version 1 is exactly 44 bytes. It
  contains float32 sample rate, observation time, hop duration, fundamental
  frequency in Hz, fractional MIDI note, cents offset, confidence, and input
  level in dB; `u32` frame index and non-zero analysis generation; and `u16`
  flags followed by a reserved `u16`. Flag bit 0 marks a voiced observation.
  Unvoiced observations set frequency, MIDI note, cents, and confidence to zero.
  Public JavaScript and Python decoders expose this as
  `PitchMeterTelemetryFrame` with `kind` `pitch`.

- **Type 27 — `TAP_ANALOG_METER`.** Format version 1 is a 4-byte header
  followed by `channelCount` 8-byte records, plus a 24-byte program record in
  Loudness mode, for an exact payload size of `4 + 8 * channelCount` bytes
  (`+ 24` in Loudness). The header contains `u8` mode (0 VU, 1 PPM, 2 RMS,
  3 Sample Peak, 4 True Peak, 5 Loudness), `u8` channel count (1-16), and `u16`
  flags: bit 0 marks a valid Integrated value and bit 1 a valid LRA, and both
  are zero outside Loudness. Outside Loudness each record holds the float32
  needle level in dB and the float32 maximum in dB since the last accepted
  frame; VU and RMS read a sine at its peak level. In Loudness each record holds
  that channel's unweighted, ungated Momentary and Short-term loudness in LUFS,
  and the program record holds float32 Momentary, Short-term, Integrated, and
  LRA, the maximum true peak in dBTP, and the Integrated accumulation time in
  seconds. Integrated and LRA read zero while their flag bits are clear. Levels
  are floored at -240 dB, and true peaks above 0 dBFS are not clamped. Public
  JavaScript and Python decoders expose this as `AnalogMeterTelemetryFrame`
  with `kind` `analogMeter`.

- **Type 28 — `TAP_RHYTHM_ANALYZER`.** Format version 1 is exactly 1344 bytes.
  A 32-byte header holds float32 sample rate, `u32` non-zero analysis
  generation, envelope hop in samples, and envelope frame count `E`, float32
  observation time and latency in seconds, `u32` count of events dropped since
  the previous accepted frame, and `u32` current event count. A 32-byte tracker
  record follows: `u32` flags (bit 0 marks a locked beat grid), `u32` lock
  epoch, float32 confidence and period in seconds, `u32` next-beat envelope
  frame, float32 fraction of that frame, `u32` next-beat index, and float32
  best comb tempo in BPM. While
  unlocked, period and next-beat fields are zero. 192 float32 tempogram values
  from 0-1 follow, then 16 event slots of 32 bytes, of which the first
  `eventCount` are valid: `u32` envelope frame, float32 fraction, `u32` lock
  epoch, `i32` beat index, float32 beat fraction from 0-1 and period in
  seconds, float32 onset strength, `u8` band (0 low, 1 mid, 2 high), `u8`
  flags (bit 0 marks an onset outside a locked grid), and a zero `u16`.
  Public JavaScript and Python decoders expose this as
  `RhythmAnalyzerTelemetryFrame` with `kind` `rhythmAnalyzer`.

- **Type 29 — `TAP_TONAL_BALANCE_EQ`.** Format version 1 is exactly 1564
  bytes, emitted at most 15 times per second. A 24-byte header holds float32
  sample rate, `u16` band count (41) and grid count (128), `u8` state flags
  (bit 0 the last 400 ms block passed the -70 LKFS absolute gate, bit 1 it also
  passed the relative gate, bit 2 a valid integrated loudness, bit 3 a target
  with data), `u8` target index, a zero `u16`, float32 integrated gated
  loudness in LKFS (zero while bit 2 is clear) and make-up gain in dB, and
  `u32` gated-in analysis hop count. Six float32 arrays of 41 values follow
  for ERB-rate bands `f_b = (10^((b+1)/21.4) - 1) * 1000 / 4.37` Hz (26 Hz to
  18.6 kHz): measured level in dB on the Average SPL scale, persistence and
  presence from 0-1, the correction command in dB, and the active target mean
  and standard deviation in dB. 41 `u8` band flags follow (bit 0 stationary,
  bit 1 noise floor, bit 2 has target, bit 3 has level, bit 4 inside Low-High),
  then three zero bytes and 128 float32 values of the applied response,
  including make-up gain, in dB at `20 * 1000^(i/127)` Hz. Public JavaScript
  and Python decoders expose this as `TonalBalanceEQTelemetryFrame` with `kind`
  `tonalBalance`.

### Latency and Pipeline Descriptors

`et_instance_latency` reflects staged parameters immediately.
BrickwallLimiter reports:

- At 1x oversampling:
  `max(1, ceil(lookaheadMs * sampleRate / 1000))` samples
- At 2x, 4x, or 8x oversampling: the same lookahead term plus
  `ceil(62 / oversampling)` samples

The routed EffeTune host reports and compensates aggregate pipeline latency.
Serial library bindings report latency without trimming or padding rendered
output, leaving offline placement to the host application.

The Phase-5 pipeline descriptor is validated transactionally. A malformed
descriptor returns `ET_ERR_DESC` and leaves the previous valid descriptor
active. Processing supports the existing channel-slice, section-gate, replace,
and cross-bus additive semantics.

### Shared DSP Primitives

Reusable real-time helpers live under `include/effetune/dsp/`:

- `biquad.h` provides binary64 DF-I and TDF-II coefficients/state plus explicit legacy
  Float32 persistence-point quantization.
- `delay_line.h` provides a prepare-time allocated, multichannel circular delay with
  integer and linearly interpolated reads.
- `smoothing.h` provides one-pole, attack/release envelope, and linear smoothing state.
- `math.h` provides dB/linear conversion, branch-based clamping, and denormal flushing.
- `xorshift_rng.h` provides the reference-compatible xorshift64 13/7/17 sequence and
  53-bit float conversion used by parity-sensitive noise and modulation kernels.

Prefer these helpers when their state and coefficient semantics match the JavaScript
reference. Parity takes precedence when a legacy processor intentionally uses a different
formula or persistence point.

### Adding a Kernel

1. Add `dsp/plugins/<category>/<plugin>/params.json` and `kernel.cpp`.
2. Add one alphabetical `EFFETUNE_PLUGIN` entry to `registry.inc`.
3. Run `npm run gen:dsp` and the parity generator before implementing the kernel.
4. Derive from `PluginKernel`, use `EFFETUNE_PARAMS`, and register with
   `EFFETUNE_REGISTER_KERNEL` using the exact JavaScript constructor name.
5. Allocate persistent state only in `prepare`; `process` must not allocate, lock, throw,
   perform I/O, or depend on a fixed frame count.

The shared native parity runner needs no per-plugin CMake entry. A dedicated complex
`native_test.cpp` is not auto-discovered, so it must also be registered explicitly with
`add_executable` and `add_test` in `dsp/CMakeLists.txt`.

Production kernels are registered in `dsp/registry.inc`; the committed WASM metadata
records that registry and each generated parameter-layout hash. Native unit tests also add
a test-only gain kernel to exercise lifecycle, parameter, routing, and telemetry contracts.

### Vendored Code

`vendor/pffft/` contains the minimal float PFFFT v1.1.0 source used directly by the
Spectrum Analyzer and Spectrogram kernels. The baseline artifact uses PFFFT's scalar
path; the SIMD artifact compiles PFFFT with WebAssembly SIMD128 enabled. See
`vendor/pffft/LICENSE.txt` and `plugins/dsp/NOTICE.txt`.
